@article{teets2012,
	Abstract = {Among terrestrial organisms, arthropods are especially susceptible to dehydration, given their small body size and high surface area to volume ratio. This challenge is particularly acute for polar arthropods that face near-constant desiccating conditions, as water is frozen and thus unavailable for much of the year. The molecular mechanisms that govern extreme dehydration tolerance in insects remain largely undefined. In this study, we used {RNA} sequencing to quantify transcriptional mechanisms of extreme dehydration tolerance in the Antarctic midge, Belgica antarctica, the world's southernmost insect and only insect endemic to Antarctica. Larvae of B. antarctica are remarkably tolerant of dehydration, surviving losses up to 70\% of their body water. Gene expression changes in response to dehydration indicated up-regulation of cellular recycling pathways including the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome and autophagy, with concurrent down-regulation of genes involved in general metabolism and {ATP} production. Metabolomics results revealed shifts in metabolite pools that correlated closely with changes in gene expression, indicating that coordinated changes in gene expression and metabolism are a critical component of the dehydration response. Finally, using comparative genomics, we compared our gene expression results with a transcriptomic dataset for the Arctic collembolan, Megaphorura arctica. Although B. antarctica and M. arctica are adapted to similar environments, our analysis indicated very little overlap in expression profiles between these two arthropods. Whereas several orthologous genes showed similar expression patterns, transcriptional changes were largely species specific, indicating these polar arthropods have developed distinct transcriptional mechanisms to cope with similar desiccating conditions.},

@article{whitehead2006,
	Abstract = {Variation among populations in gene expression should be related to the accumulation of random-neutral changes and evolution by natural selection. The following evolutionary analysis has general applicability to biological and medical science because it accounts for genetic relatedness and identifies patterns of expression variation that are affected by natural selection. To identify genes evolving by natural selection, we allocate the maximum among-population variation to genetic distance and then examine the remaining variation relative to a hypothesized important ecological parameter (temperature). These analyses measure the expression of metabolic genes in common-gardened populations of the fish Fundulus heteroclitus whose habitat is distributed along a steep thermal gradient. Although much of the variation in gene expression fits a null model of neutral drift, the variation in expression for 22\% of the genes that regress with habitat temperature was far greater than could be accounted for by genetic distance alone. The most parsimonious explanation for among-population variation for these genes is evolution by natural selection. In addition, many metabolic genes have patterns of variation incongruent with neutral evolution: They have too much or too little variation. These patterns of biological variation in expression may reflect important physiological or ecological functions.},

@article{vijay2013,
	Abstract = {Transcriptome Shotgun Sequencing ({RNA}-seq) has been readily embraced by geneticists and molecular ecologists alike. As with all high-throughput technologies, it is critical to understand which analytic strategies are best suited and which parameters may bias the interpretation of the data. Here we use a comprehensive simulation approach to explore how various features of the transcriptome (complexity, degree of polymorphism π, alternative splicing), technological processing (sequencing error ε, library normalization) and bioinformatic workflow (de novo vs. mapping assembly, reference genome quality) impact transcriptome quality and inference of differential gene expression ({DE}). We find that transcriptome assembly and gene expression profiling ({EdgeR} vs. {BaySeq} software) works well even in the absence of a reference genome and is robust across a broad range of parameters. We advise against library normalization and in most situations advocate mapping assemblies to an annotated genome of a divergent sister clade, which generally outperformed de novo assembly (Trans-Abyss, Trinity, Soapdenovo-Trans). Transcriptome complexity (size, paralogs, alternative splicing isoforms) negatively affected the assembly and {DE} profiling, whereas the effects of sequencing error and polymorphism were almost negligible. Finally, we highlight the challenge of gene name assignment for de novo assemblies, the importance of mapping strategies and raise awareness of challenges associated with the quality of reference genomes. Overall, our results have significant practical and methodological implications and can provide guidance in the design and analysis of {RNA}-seq experiments, particularly for organisms where genomic background information is lacking.},

@article{rodriguez-cabal2012,
	Abstract = {By disrupting the structure of native ant assemblages, invasive ants can have effects across trophic levels. Most studies to date, however, have focused on the impacts just two species (Linepithema humile and Solenopsis invicta). The impacts of many other invasive ant species on ecological processes in their introduced range are unknown. In this study we tested the hypothesis that the invasive ant Pachycondyla chinensis disrupts ant-seed dispersal mutualisms by displacing native ant species, especially the keystone mutualist Aphaenogaster rudis, while failing to disperse seeds itself. In a paired design we measured the impact of P. chinensis on the native ant-plant seed dispersal mutualism. The number of A. rudis workers was 96\% lower in invaded than in intact plots, and the number of seeds removed was 70\% lower in these plots. Finally, in invaded plots the abundance of Hexastylis arifolia, a locally abundant myrmecochorous plant, was 50\% lower than in plots where P. chinensis was absent. A parsimonious interpretation of our results is that P. chinensis causes precipitous declines in the abundance of A. rudis within invaded communities, thereby disrupting the ant-plant seed dispersal mutualisms and reducing abundances of ant-dispersed plants. In sum, the magnitude of the effects of P. chinensis on seed dispersal is quantitatively similar to that documented for the intensively studied invasive Argentine ant. We suggest that more studies on the impacts of less-studied invasive ant species on seed dispersal mutualisms may increase our knowledge of the effects of these invaders on ecosystem function.},

	Abstract = {{BackgroundChrysopa} pallens (Rambur) are the most important natural enemies and predators of various agricultural pests. Understanding the sophisticated olfactory system in insect antennae is crucial for studying the physiological bases of olfaction and also could lead to effective applications of C. pallens in integrated pest management. However no transcriptome information is available for Neuroptera, and sequence data for C. pallens are scarce, so obtaining more sequence data is a priority for researchers on this species.{ResultsTo} facilitate identifying sets of genes involved in olfaction, a normalized transcriptome of C. pallens was sequenced. A total of 104,603 contigs were obtained and assembled into 10,662 clusters and 39,734 singletons; 20,524 were annotated based on {BLASTX} analyses. A large number of candidate chemosensory genes were identified, including 14 odorant-binding proteins ({OBPs}), 22 chemosensory proteins ({CSPs}), 16 ionotropic receptors, 14 odorant receptors, and genes potentially involved in olfactory modulation. To better understand the {OBPs}, {CSPs} and cytochrome P450s, phylogenetic trees were constructed. In addition, 10 digital gene expression libraries of different tissues were constructed and gene expression profiles were compared among different tissues in males and females.{ConclusionsOur} results provide a basis for exploring the mechanisms of chemoreception in C. pallens, as well as other insects. The evolutionary analyses in our study provide new insights into the differentiation and evolution of insect {OBPs} and {CSPs}. Our study provided large-scale sequence information for further studies in C. pallens.},

@article{pespeni2013,
	Abstract = {Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide ({CO}2) conditions are driving unprecedented changes in seawater chemistry, resulting in reduced {pH} and carbonate ion concentrations in the Earth's oceans. This ocean acidification has negative but variable impacts on individual performance in many marine species. However, little is known about the adaptive capacity of species to respond to an acidified ocean, and, as a result, predictions regarding future ecosystem responses remain incomplete. Here we demonstrate that ocean acidification generates striking patterns of genome-wide selection in purple sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) cultured under different {CO}2 levels. We examined genetic change at 19,493 loci in larvae from seven adult populations cultured under realistic future {CO}2 levels. Although larval development and morphology showed little response to elevated {CO}2, we found substantial allelic change in 40 functional classes of proteins involving hundreds of loci. Pronounced genetic changes, including excess amino acid replacements, were detected in all populations and occurred in genes for biomineralization, lipid metabolism, and ion homeostasis---gene classes that build skeletons and interact in {pH} regulation. Such genetic change represents a neglected and important impact of ocean acidification that may influence populations that show few outward signs of response to acidification. Our results demonstrate the capacity for rapid evolution in the face of ocean acidification and show that standing genetic variation could be a reservoir of resilience to climate change in this coastal upwelling ecosystem. However, effective response to strong natural selection demands large population sizes and may be limited in species impacted by other environmental stressors.},

	Abstract = {Drosophila melanogaster experience cold shock injury and die when exposed to low non-freezing temperatures. In this study, we generated transgenic D. melanogaster that express putative Ixodes scapularis antifreeze glycoprotein ({IAFGP}) and show that the presence of {IAFGP} increases the ability of flies to survive in the cold. Male and female adult iafgp-expressing D. melanogaster exhibited higher survival rates compared with controls when placed at non-freezing temperatures. Increased hatching rates were evident in embryos expressing {IAFGP} when exposed to the cold. The {TUNEL} assay showed that flight muscles from iafgp-expressing female adult flies exhibited less apoptotic damage upon exposure to non-freezing temperatures in comparison to control flies.

	Abstract = {Global analysis of {mRNA} abundance via genomic arrays (i.e. transcriptomics or transcriptional profiling) is one approach to finding the genes that matter to organisms undergoing environmental stress. In evolutionary analyses of stress, {mRNA} abundance is often invoked as a proxy for the protein activity that may underlie variation in fitness. To provoke discussion of the utility and sensible application of this valuable approach, this manuscript examines the adequacy of {mRNA} abundance as a proxy for protein activity, fitness and stress. Published work to date suggests that {mRNA} abundance typically provides little information on protein activity and fitness and cannot substitute for detailed functional and ecological analyses of candidate genes. While the transcriptional profile can be an exquisitely sensitive indicator of stress, simpler indicators will often suffice. In view of this outcome, transcriptomics should undergo careful cost-benefit analysis before investigators deploy it in studies of stress responses and their evolution.},

	Abstract = {Collective behaviour, arising from local interactions, allows groups to respond to changing conditions. Long-term studies have shown that the traits of individual mammals and birds are associated with their reproductive success, but little is known about the evolutionary ecology of collective behaviour in natural populations. An ant colony operates without central control, regulating its activity through a network of local interactions. This work shows that variation among harvester ant (Pogonomyrmex barbatus) colonies in collective response to changing conditions is related to variation in colony lifetime reproductive success in the production of offspring colonies. Desiccation costs are high for harvester ants foraging in the desert. More successful colonies tend to forage less when conditions are dry, and show relatively stable foraging activity when conditions are more humid. Restraint from foraging does not compromise a colony/'s long-term survival; colonies that fail to forage at all on many days survive as long, over the colony/'s 20-30-year lifespan, as those that forage more regularly. Sensitivity to conditions in which to reduce foraging activity may be transmissible from parent to offspring colony. These results indicate that natural selection is shaping the collective behaviour that regulates foraging activity, and that the selection pressure, related to climate, may grow stronger if the current drought in their habitat persists.},

	Abstract = {Physiological intolerance of high temperatures places limits on organismal responses to the temperature increases associated with global climatic change. Because ants are geographically widespread, ecologically diverse, and thermophilic, they are an ideal system for exploring the extent to which physiological tolerance can predict responses to environmental change. Here, we expand on simple models that use thermal tolerance to predict the responses of ants to climatic warming. We investigated the degree to which changes in the abundance of ants under warming reflect reductions in the thermal niche space for their foraging. In an eastern deciduous forest system in the United States with approximately 40 ant species, we found that for some species, the loss of thermal niche space for foraging was related to decreases in abundance with increasing experimental climatic warming. However, many ant species exhibited no loss of thermal niche space. For one well-studied species, Temnothorax curvispinosus, we examined both survival of workers and growth of colonies (a correlate of reproductive output) as functions of temperature in the laboratory, and found that the range of thermal tolerances for colony growth was much narrower than for survival of workers. We evaluated these functions in the context of experimental climatic warming and found that the difference in the responses of these two attributes to temperature generates differences in the means and especially the variances of expected fitness under warming. The expected mean growth of colonies was optimized at intermediate levels of warming (2--4$\,^{\circ}$C above ambient); yet, the expected variance monotonically increased with warming. In contrast, the expected mean and variance of the survival of workers decreased when warming exceeded 4$\,^{\circ}$C above ambient. Together, these results for T. curvispinosus emphasize the importance of measuring reproduction (colony growth) in the context of climatic change: indeed, our examination of the loss of thermal niche space with the larger species pool could be missing much of the warming impact due to these analyses being based on survival rather than reproduction. We suggest that while physiological tolerance of temperature can be a useful predictive tool for modeling responses to climatic change, future efforts should be devoted to understanding the causes and consequences of variability in models of tolerance calibrated with different metrics of performance and fitness.},

	Abstract = {* Climate change will increase both average temperatures and extreme summer temperatures. Analyses of the fitness consequences of climate change have generally omitted negative fitness and population declines associated with heat stress. * Here, we examine how seasonal and interannual temperature variability will impact fitness shifts of ectotherms from the past (1961--1990) to future (2071--2100), by modelling thermal performance curves ({TPCs}) for insect species across latitudes. * In temperate regions, climate change increased the length of the growing season (increasing fitness) and increased the frequency of heat stress (decreasing fitness). Consequently, species at mid-latitudes (20--40$\,^{\circ}$) showed pronounced but heterogeneous responses to climate change. Fitness decreases for these species were accompanied by greater interannual variation in fitness. An alternative {TPC} model and a larger data set gave qualitatively similar results. * How close maximum summer temperatures are to the critical thermal maximum of a species -- the thermal buffer -- is a good predictor of the change in mean fitness expected under climate change. Thermal buffers will decrease to near or below zero by 2100 for many tropical and mid-latitude species. * Our forecasts suggest that mid-latitude species will be particularly susceptible to heat stress associated with climate change due to temperature variation.},

	Abstract = {Genetic variation for plastic phenotypes potentially contributes phenotypic variation to populations that can be selected during adaptation to novel ecological contexts. However, the basis and extent of plastic variation that manifests in diverse environments remains elusive. Here we characterize copper reaction norms for {mRNA} abundance among five S. cerevisiae strains to a) describe population variation across the full range of ecologically relevant copper concentrations, from starvation to toxicity, and b) to test the hypothesis that plastic networks exhibit increased population variation for gene expression. We find that although the vast majority of the variation is small in magnitude (considerably less than two-fold), not just some, but most genes demonstrate variable expression across environments, across genetic backgrounds, or both. Plastically expressed genes included both genes regulated directly by copper-binding transcription factors Mac1 and Ace1 and genes indirectly responding to the downstream metabolic consequences of the copper gradient, particularly genes involved in copper, iron, and sulfur homeostasis. Copper-regulated gene networks exhibited more similar behavior within the population in environments where those networks have a large impact on fitness. Nevertheless, expression variation in genes like Cup1, important to surviving copper stress, was linked with variation in mitotic fitness and in the breadth of differential expression across the genome. By revealing a broader and deeper range of population variation, our results provide further evidence for the interconnectedness of genome-wide {mRNA} levels, their dependence on environmental context and genetic background, and the abundance of variation in gene expression that can contribute to future evolution.},

	Abstract = {Both genetic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity might be expected to affect the location of geographic range limits. Co-gradient variation ({CoGV}), plasticity that is congruent with genetic differentiation, may enhance performance at range margins, whereas its opposite, counter-gradient variation ({CnGV}) may hinder performance. Here we report findings of reciprocal transplant experiments intended to tease apart the roles of differentiation and plasticity in producing phenotypic variation across a geographic border between two plant subspecies. Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana and C. xantiana ssp. parviflora are California-endemic annuals that replace each other along a west-east gradient of declining precipitation. We analyzed variation in floral traits, phenological traits, and vegetative morphological and developmental traits by sowing seeds of 18 populations (six of ssp. xantiana and 12 of ssp. parviflora) at three sites (one in each subspecies' exclusive range and one in the subspecies' contact zone), in two growing seasons (an exceptionally wet El Ni{\~n}o winter and a much drier La Ni{\~n}a winter). Significant genetic differences between subspecies appeared in 11 of 12 traits, and differences were of the same sign as in nature. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that selection is responsible for subspecies differences. Geographic variation within subspecies over part of the spatial gradient mirrored between-subspecies differences present at a larger scale. All traits showed significant plasticity in response to spatial and temporal environmental variation. Plasticity patterns ranged from spatial and temporal {CoGV} (e.g., in node of first flower), to spatial {CnGV} (e.g., in flowering time), to patterns that were neither {CoGV} nor {CnGV} (the majority of traits). Instances of {CoGV} may reflect adaptive plasticity and may serve to increase performance under year-to-year environmental variation and at sites near the subspecies border. However, the presence of spatial {CnGV} in some critical traits suggests that subspecies ranges may also be constrained by patterns of plasticity.},

The diversity of social organization in ants makes them excellent model organisms to study the evolution of social systems. Comparing the ant genomes with those of the honeybee, a lineage that evolved eusociality independently from ants, and solitary insects suggests that there are significant differences in key aspects of genome organization between social and solitary insects, as well as among ant species.

	Abstract = {Laboratory model systems and mathematical models have shed considerable light on the fundamental properties and processes of evolutionary rescue. But it remains to determine the extent to which these model-based findings can help biologists predict when evolution will fail or succeed in rescuing natural populations that are facing novel conditions that threaten their persistence. In this article, we present a prospectus for transferring our basic understanding of evolutionary rescue to wild and other non-laboratory populations. Current experimental and theoretical results emphasize how the interplay between inheritance processes and absolute fitness in changed environments drive population dynamics and determine prospects of extinction. We discuss the challenge of inferring these elements of the evolutionary rescue process in field and natural settings. Addressing this challenge will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of population persistence that combines processes of evolutionary rescue with developmental and ecological mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {Measures of {RNA} abundance are important for many areas of biology and often obtained from high-throughput {RNA} sequencing methods such as Illumina sequence data. These measures need to be normalized to remove technical biases inherent in the sequencing approach, most notably the length of the {RNA} species and the sequencing depth of a sample. These biases are corrected in the widely used reads per kilobase per million reads ({RPKM}) measure. Here, we argue that the intended meaning of {RPKM} is a measure of relative molar {RNA} concentration (rmc) and show that for each set of transcripts the average rmc is a constant, namely the inverse of the number of transcripts mapped. Further, we show that {RPKM} does not respect this invariance property and thus cannot be an accurate measure of rmc. We propose a slight modification of {RPKM} that eliminates this inconsistency and call it {TPM} for transcripts per million. {TPM} respects the average invariance and eliminates statistical biases inherent in the {RPKM} measure.},

Current approaches for transcript reconstruction from such data often rely on aligning reads to a reference genome, and are thus unsuitable for samples with a partial or missing reference genome. Here we present the Trinity method for de novo assembly of full-length transcripts and evaluate it on samples from fission yeast, mouse and whitefly, whose reference genome is not yet available. By efficiently constructing and analyzing sets of de Bruijn graphs, Trinity fully reconstructs a large fraction of transcripts, including alternatively spliced isoforms and transcripts from recently duplicated genes. Compared with other de novo transcriptome assemblers, Trinity recovers more full-length transcripts across a broad range of expression levels, with a sensitivity similar to methods that rely on genome alignments. Our approach provides a unified solution for transcriptome reconstruction in any sample, especially in the absence of a reference genome.},

@article{yang2013,
	Abstract = {Background
{RNA}-seq has shown huge potential for phylogenomic inferences in non-model organisms. However, error, incompleteness, and redundant assembled transcripts for each gene in de novo assembly of short reads cause noise in analyses and a large amount of missing data in the aligned matrix. To address these problems, we compare de novo assemblies of paired end 90 bp {RNA}-seq reads using Oases, Trinity, Trans-{ABySS} and {SOAPdenovo}-Trans to transcripts from genome annotation of the model plant Ricinus communis. By doing so we evaluate strategies for optimizing total gene coverage and minimizing assembly chimeras and redundancy.

Results
We found that the frequency and structure of chimeras vary dramatically among different software packages. The differences were largely due to the number of trans-self chimeras that contain repeats in the opposite direction. More than half of the total chimeras in Oases and Trinity were trans-self chimeras. Within each package, we found a trade-off between maximizing reference coverage and minimizing redundancy and chimera rate. In order to reduce redundancy, we investigated three methods: 1) using cap3 and {CD}-{HIT}-{EST} to combine highly similar transcripts, 2) only retaining the transcript with the highest read coverage, or removing the transcript with the lowest read coverage for each subcomponent in Trinity, and 3) filtering Oases single k-mer assemblies by number of transcripts per locus and relative transcript length, and then finding the transcript with the highest read coverage. We then utilized results from blastx against model protein sequences to effectively remove trans chimeras. After optimization, seven assembly strategies among all four packages successfully assembled 42.9--47.1\% of reference genes to more than 200 bp, with a chimera rate of 0.92--2.21\%, and on average 1.8--3.1 transcripts per reference gene assembled.

Conclusions
With rapidly improving sequencing and assembly tools, our study provides a framework to benchmark and optimize performance before choosing tools or parameter combinations for analyzing short-read {RNA}-seq data. Our study demonstrates that choice of assembly package, k-mer sizes, post-assembly redundancy-reduction and chimera cleanup, and strand-specific {RNA}-seq library preparation and assembly dramatically improves gene coverage by non-redundant and non-chimeric transcripts that are optimized for downstream phylogenomic analyses.},

The program has a capability to clip 5′ and 3′ low-quality regions of reads. It uses base quality values in computation of overlaps between reads, construction of multiple sequence alignments of reads, and generation of consensus sequences. The program also uses forward--reverse constraints to correct assembly errors and link contigs. Results of {CAP}3 on four {BAC} data sets are presented. The performance of {CAP}3 was compared with that of {PHRAP} on a number of {BAC} data sets. {PHRAP} often produces longer contigs than {CAP}3 whereas {CAP}3 often produces fewer errors in consensus sequences than {PHRAP}. It is easier to construct scaffolds with {CAP}3 than with {PHRAP} on low-pass data with forward--reverse constraints.},

	Abstract = {Gene expression responds to the environment and can also evolve rapidly in response to altered selection regimes. Little is known, however, about the extent to which evolutionary adaptation to a particular type of stress involves changes in the within-generation (`plastic') responses of gene expression to the stress. We used microarrays to quantify gene expression plasticity in response to ethanol in laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster differing in their history of ethanol exposure. Two populations (`R' populations) were maintained on regular medium, two (`E') were maintained on medium supplemented with ethanol, and two (`M') were maintained in a mixed regime in which half of the population was reared on one medium type, and half on the other, each generation. After more than 300 generations, embryos from each population were collected and exposed to either ethanol or water as a control, and {RNA} was extracted from the larvae shortly after hatching. Nearly 2000 transcripts showed significant within-generation responses to ethanol exposure. Evolutionary history also affected gene expression: the E and M populations were largely indistinguishable in expression, but differed significantly in expression from the R populations for over 100 transcripts, the majority of which did not show plastic responses. Notably, in no case was the interaction between selection regime and ethanol exposure significant after controlling for multiple comparisons, indicating that adaptation to ethanol in the E and M populations did not involve substantial changes in gene expression plasticity. The results give evidence that expression plasticity evolves considerably more slowly than mean expression.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: High-throughput experiments such as microarray hybridizations often yield long lists of genes found to share a certain characteristic such as differential expression. Exploring Gene Ontology ({GO}) annotations for such lists of genes has become a widespread practice to get first insights into the potential biological meaning of the experiment. The standard statistical approach to measuring overrepresentation of {GO} terms cannot cope with the dependencies resulting from the structure of {GO} because they analyze each term in isolation. Especially the fact that annotations are inherited from more specific descendant terms can result in certain types of false-positive results with potentially misleading biological interpretation, a phenomenon which we term the inheritance problem.
Results: We present here a novel approach to analysis of {GO} term overrepresentation that determines overrepresentation of terms in the context of annotations to the term's parents. This approach reduces the dependencies between the individual term's measurements, and thereby avoids producing false-positive results owing to the inheritance problem. {ROC} analysis using study sets with overrepresented {GO} terms showed a clear advantage for our approach over the standard algorithm with respect to the inheritance problem. Although there can be no gold standard for exploratory methods such as analysis of {GO} term overrepresentation, analysis of biological datasets suggests that our algorithm tends to identify the core {GO} terms that are most characteristic of the dataset being analyzed.

	Abstract = {The impact of anthropogenic climate change on terrestrial organisms is often predicted to increase with latitude, in parallel with the rate of warming. Yet the biological impact of rising temperatures also depends on the physiological sensitivity of organisms to temperature change. We integrate empirical fitness curves describing the thermal tolerance of terrestrial insects from around the world with the projected geographic distribution of climate change for the next century to estimate the direct impact of warming on insect fitness across latitude. The results show that warming in the tropics, although relatively small in magnitude, is likely to have the most deleterious consequences because tropical insects are relatively sensitive to temperature change and are currently living very close to their optimal temperature. In contrast, species at higher latitudes have broader thermal tolerance and are living in climates that are currently cooler than their physiological optima, so that warming may even enhance their fitness. Available thermal tolerance data for several vertebrate taxa exhibit similar patterns, suggesting that these results are general for terrestrial ectotherms. Our analyses imply that, in the absence of ameliorating factors such as migration and adaptation, the greatest extinction risks from global warming may be in the tropics, where biological diversity is also greatest.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: The result of a typical microarray experiment is a long list of genes with corresponding expression measurements. This list is only the starting point for a meaningful biological interpretation. Modern methods identify relevant biological processes or functions from gene expression data by scoring the statistical significance of predefined functional gene groups, e.g. based on Gene Ontology ({GO}). We develop methods that increase the explanatory power of this approach by integrating knowledge about relationships between the {GO} terms into the calculation of the statistical significance.
Results: We present two novel algorithms that improve {GO} group scoring using the underlying {GO} graph topology. The algorithms are evaluated on real and simulated gene expression data. We show that both methods eliminate local dependencies between {GO} terms and point to relevant areas in the {GO} graph that remain undetected with state-of-the-art algorithms for scoring functional terms. A simulation study demonstrates that the new methods exhibit a higher level of detecting relevant biological terms than competing methods.

	Abstract = {Reef corals are highly sensitive to heat, yet populations resistant to climate change have recently been identified. To determine the mechanisms of temperature tolerance, we reciprocally transplanted corals between reef sites experiencing distinct temperature regimes and tested subsequent physiological and gene expression profiles. Local acclimatization and fixed effects, such as adaptation, contributed about equally to heat tolerance and are reflected in patterns of gene expression. In less than 2 years, acclimatization achieves the same heat tolerance that we would expect from strong natural selection over many generations for these long-lived organisms. Our results show both short-term acclimatory and longer-term adaptive acquisition of climate resistance. Adding these adaptive abilities to ecosystem models is likely to slow predictions of demise for coral reef ecosystems.
Hot and bothered corals can cope
How well can corals adapt to temperature extremes? Better than anticipated, it turns out. Corals from reef pools with wide temperature fluctuations resist stress better than corals from less extreme pools. Nevertheless, corals transplanted into the hotter and more variable conditions soon acquired thermal tolerance. Palumbi et al. (see the Perspective by Eakin) found that the tougher specimens produced more of certain proteins, such as the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, which protected them from the effects of heat. Ramping up heat shock and transport proteins yielded heat tolerance far more rapidly than mutation and adaptation. Hopefully, this ability will allow some mitigation of climate change on coral reefs.

	Abstract = {{SNPs} discovered by genome-wide association studies ({GWASs}) account for only a small fraction of the genetic variation of complex traits in human populations. Where is the remaining heritability? We estimated the proportion of variance for human height explained by 294,831 {SNPs} genotyped on 3,925 unrelated individuals using a linear model analysis, and validated the estimation method with simulations based on the observed genotype data. We show that 45\% of variance can be explained by considering all {SNPs} simultaneously. Thus, most of the heritability is not missing but has not previously been detected because the individual effects are too small to pass stringent significance tests. We provide evidence that the remaining heritability is due to incomplete linkage disequilibrium between causal variants and genotyped {SNPs}, exacerbated by causal variants having lower minor allele frequency than the {SNPs} explored to date.},

	Abstract = {Microarray technologies allow the identification of large numbers of expression differences within and between species. Although environmental and physiological stimuli are clearly responsible for changes in the expression levels of many genes, it is not known whether the majority of changes of gene expression fixed during evolution between species and between various tissues within a species are caused by Darwinian selection or by stochastic processes. We find the following: (1) expression differences between species accumulate approximately linearly with time; (2) gene expression variation among individuals within a species correlates positively with expression divergence between species; (3) rates of expression divergence between species do not differ significantly between intact genes and expressed pseudogenes; (4) expression differences between brain regions within a species have accumulated approximately linearly with time since these regions emerged during evolution. These results suggest that the majority of expression differences observed between species are selectively neutral or nearly neutral and likely to be of little or no functional significance. Therefore, the identification of gene expression differences between species fixed by selection should be based on null hypotheses assuming functional neutrality. Furthermore, it may be possible to apply a molecular clock based on expression differences to infer the evolutionary history of tissues.},

	Abstract = {Rapid climate change may prompt species distribution shifts upward and poleward, but species movement in itself is not sufficient to establish climate causation. Other dynamics, such as disturbance history, may prompt species distribution shifts resembling those expected from rapid climate change. Links between species distributions, regional climate trends and physiological mechanism are needed to convincingly establish climate-induced species shifts. We examine a 38-year shift (1974--2012) in an elevation ecotone between two closely related ant species, Aphaenogaster picea and A. rudis. Even though A. picea and A. rudis are closely related with North American distributions that sometimes overlap, they also exhibit local- and regional-scale differences in temperature requirements so that A. rudis is more southerly and inhabits lower elevations whereas A. picea is more northerly and inhabits high elevations. We find considerable movement by the warm-habitat species upward in elevation between 1974 and 2012 with A. rudis, replacing the cold-habitat species, A. picea, along the southern edge of the Appalachian Mountain chain in north Georgia, {USA}. Concomitant with the distribution shifts, regional mean and maximum temperatures remain steady (1974--2012), but minimum temperatures increase. We collect individuals from the study sites and subject them to thermal tolerance testing in a controlled setting and find that maximum and minimum temperature acclimatization occurs along the elevation gradient in both species, but A. rudis consistently becomes physiologically incapacitated at minimum and maximum temperatures 2 $\,^{\circ}$C higher than A. picea. These results indicate that rising minimum temperatures allow A. rudis to move upward in elevation and displace A. picea. Given that Aphaenogaster ants are the dominant woodland seed dispersers in eastern deciduous forests, and that their thermal tolerances drive distinct differences in temperature-cued synchrony with early blooming plants, these climate responses not only impact ant-ant interactions, but might have wide implications for ant-plant interactions.},

	Abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate ({FWER}). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the {FWER} when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the {FWER} is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

@article{morgan2006,
	Abstract = {For insects, temperature is a major environmental variable that can influence an individual's behavioral activities and fitness. Drosophila melanogaster is a cosmopolitan species that has had great success in adapting to and colonizing diverse thermal niches. This adaptation and colonization has resulted in complex patterns of genetic variation in thermotolerance phenotypes in nature. Although extensive work has been conducted documenting patterns of genetic variation, substantially less is known about the genomic regions or genes that underlie this ecologically and evolutionarily important genetic variation. To begin to understand and identify the genes controlling thermotolerance phenotypes, we have used a mapping population of recombinant inbred ({RI}) lines to map quantitative trait loci ({QTL}) that affect variation in both heat- and cold-stress resistance. The mapping population was derived from a cross between two lines of D. melanogaster (Oregon-R and 2b) that were not selected for thermotolerance phenotypes, but exhibit significant genetic divergence for both phenotypes. Using a design in which each {RI} line was backcrossed to both parental lines, we mapped seven {QTL} affecting thermotolerance on the second and third chromosomes. Three of the {QTL} influence cold-stress resistance and four affect heat-stress resistance. Most of the {QTL} were trait or sex specific, suggesting that overlapping but generally unique genetic architectures underlie resistance to low- and high-temperature extremes. Each {QTL} explained between 5 and 14\% of the genetic variance among lines, and degrees of dominance ranged from completely additive to partial dominance. Potential thermotolerance candidate loci contained within our {QTL} regions are identified and discussed.},

	Abstract = {Linear regression and analysis of variance ({ANOVA}) are two of the most widely used statistical techniques in ecology. Regression quantitatively describes the relationship between a response variable and one or more continuous independent variables, while {ANOVA} determines whether a response variable differs among discrete values of the independent variable(s). Designing experiments with discrete factors is straightforward because {ANOVA} is the only option, but what is the best way to design experiments involving continuous factors? Should ecologists prefer experiments with few treatments and many replicates analyzed with {ANOVA}, or experiments with many treatments and few replicates per treatment analyzed with regression? We recommend that ecologists choose regression, especially replicated regression, over {ANOVA} when dealing with continuous factors for two reasons: (1) regression is generally a more powerful approach than {ANOVA} and (2) regression provides quantitative output that can be incorporated into ecological models more effectively than {ANOVA} output.},

@article{calabria2012,
	Abstract = {Theory predicts that geographic variation in traits and genes associated with climatic adaptation may be initially driven by the correlated evolution of thermal preference and thermal sensitivity. This assumes that an organism's preferred body temperature corresponds with the thermal optimum in which performance is maximized; hence, shifts in thermal preferences affect the subsequent evolution of thermal-related traits. Drosophila subobscura evolved worldwide latitudinal clines in several traits including chromosome inversion frequencies, with some polymorphic inversions being apparently associated with thermal preference and thermal tolerance. Here we show that flies carrying the warm-climate chromosome arrangement O3+4 have higher basal protein levels of Hsp70 than their cold-climate Ost counterparts, but this difference disappears after heat hardening. O3+4 carriers are also more heat tolerant, although it is difficult to conclude from our results that this is causally linked to their higher basal levels of Hsp70. The observed patterns are consistent with the thermal co-adaptation hypothesis and suggest that the interplay between behaviour and physiology underlies latitudinal and seasonal shifts in inversion frequencies.},

	Abstract = {Stress tolerance is often measured as a threshold trait, the proportion of a group that survives a defined stress regime. Requirements of large offspring numbers coupled with fitness variation in the surviving cohort limit the use of some standard genetic analyses for estimating heritability. Therefore, we present an isofemale line analysis, which is a modified full-sib design, to estimate heritability of tolerance to heat shock in pretreated Drosophila buzzatii adults. Highly significant levels of genetic variation were found in males and females at the third generation of laboratory rearing, and the intraclass correlations were estimated to be about 0.2 for four independent sets of 25 isofemale lines. The proportion of the variance explained within lines among same-sex replicates, however, was larger than that between replicates of males and females. Because genetic variation was estimated from groups, the error variation required factoring by the group size to estimate heritability, which averaged 0.03. The four most tolerant, four least tolerant and four lines of average tolerance to heat stress in each set were reanalysed after 10--11 generations of rearing at 25$\,^{\circ}$C. Survival in the 13th--14th generations was positively and significantly associated with survival at generation 3. These comparisons indicate the high repeatability of measurements of heat-shock tolerance.},

A composite interval mapping was performed on the two major autosomes of Drosophila melanogaster to search for quantitative trait loci ({QTL}) affecting knockdown resistance to high temperature ({KRHT}). Two dramatically divergent lines from geographically different thermal environments were artificially selected on {KRHT}. These lines were crossed to produce two backcross ({BC}) populations. Each {BC} was analysed for 200 males with 18 marker loci on chromosomes 2 and 3. Three X-linked markers were used to test for X-linked {QTL} in an exploratory way. The largest estimate of autosome additive effects was found in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 2, accounting for 19.26\% ({BC} to the low line) and 29.15\% ({BC} to the high line) of the phenotypic variance in {BC} populations, but it could represent multiple closely linked {QTL}. Complete dominance was apparent for three {QTL} on chromosome 3, where heat-shock genes are concentrated. Exploratory analysis of chromosome X indicated a substantial contribution of this chromosome to {KRHT}. The results show that a large-effect {QTL} with dominant gene action maps on the right arm of chromosome 3. Further, the results confirm that {QTL} for heat resistance are not limited to chromosome 3.},

	Abstract = {Although Hsp70, the principal inducible heat-shock protein of Drosophila melanogaster, has received intense scrutiny in laboratory strains, its variation within natural populations and the consequences of such variation for thermotolerance are unknown. We have characterized variation in first-instar larvae of 20 isofemale lines isolated from a single natural population of D. melanogaster, in which larvae are prone to thermal stress in nature. Hsp70 expression varied more than twofold among lines after induction by exposure to 36⚬C for one hour, with an estimated proportion of the variation due to genetic differences of 0.24 $\pm$ 0.08. Thermotolerance with and without a Hsp70-inducing pretreatment, survival at 25⚬C, and developmental time also varied significantly. As expected, expression of Hsp70 correlated positively with larval thermotolerance. By contrast, lines in which larval survival was high in the absence of heat stress showed lower than average Hsp70 expression and lower than average inducible thermotolerance. This conditional performance suggests an evolutionary trade-off between thermotolerance and the ability to produce higher concentrations of Hsp70, and survival in a benign environment.},

	Abstract = {Embryonic development in Drosophila is characterized by an early phase during which a cellular blastoderm is formed and gastrulation takes place, and by a later postgastrulation phase in which key morphogenetic processes such as segmentation and organogenesis occur. We have focused on this later phase in embryogenesis with the goal of obtaining a comprehensive analysis of the zygotic gene expression that occurs during development under normal and altered environmental conditions. For this, a functional genomic approach to embryogenesis has been developed that uses high-density oligonucleotide arrays for large-scale detection and quantification of gene expression. These oligonucleotide arrays were used for quantitative transcript imaging of embryonically expressed genes under standard conditions and in response to heat shock. In embryos raised under standard conditions, transcripts were detected for 37\% of the 1,519 identified genes represented on the arrays, and highly reproducible quantification of gene expression was achieved in all cases. Analysis of differential gene expression after heat shock revealed substantial expression level changes for known heat-shock genes and identified numerous heat shock-inducible genes. These results demonstrate that high-density oligonucleotide arrays are sensitive, efficient, and quantitative instruments for the analysis of large scale gene expression in Drosophila embryos.},

	Abstract = {Marine stickleback fish have colonized and adapted to thousands of streams and lakes formed since the last ice age, providing an exceptional opportunity to characterize genomic mechanisms underlying repeated ecological adaptation in nature. Here we develop a high-quality reference genome assembly for threespine sticklebacks. By sequencing the genomes of twenty additional individuals from a global set of marine and freshwater populations, we identify a genome-wide set of loci that are consistently associated with marine--freshwater divergence. Our results indicate that reuse of globally shared standing genetic variation, including chromosomal inversions, has an important role in repeated evolution of distinct marine and freshwater sticklebacks, and in the maintenance of divergent ecotypes during early stages of reproductive isolation. Both coding and regulatory changes occur in the set of loci underlying marine--freshwater evolution, but regulatory changes appear to predominate in this well known example of repeated adaptive evolution in nature.},

	Abstract = {Exposure to extreme temperatures is increasingly likely to impose strong selection on many organisms in their natural environments. The ability of organisms to adapt to such selective pressures will be determined by patterns of genetic variation and covariation. Despite increasing interest in thermal adaptation, few studies have examined the extent to which the genetic covariance between traits might constrain thermal responses. Furthermore, it remains unknown whether sex-specific genetic architectures will constrain responses to climatic selection. We used a paternal half-sibling breeding design to examine whether sex-specific genetic architectures and genetic covariances between traits might constrain evolutionary responses to warming climates in a population of Drosophila melanogaster. Our results suggest that the sexes share a common genetic underpinning for heat tolerance as indicated by a strong positive inter-sexual genetic correlation. Further, we found no evidence in either of the sexes that genetic trade-offs between heat tolerance and fitness will constrain responses to thermal selection. Our results suggest that neither trade-offs, nor sex-specific genetics, will significantly constrain an evolutionary response to climatic warming, at least in this population of D. melanogaster.},

@article{krebs1998,
	Abstract = {The principle inducible heat-shock protein of Drosophila melanogaster, Hsp70, contributes to thermotolerance throughout the entire life cycle of the species but may also reduce fitness in some life stages. In principle, selection might maximize the benefits of Hsp70 expression relative to its costs by adjusting the magnitude of Hsp70 expression for each life-cycle stage independently. Therefore we examined whether the magnitude of Hsp70 expression varied during the life cycle and the relationship of this variation to several life-history traits. For 28 isofemale lines derived from a single natural population, estimates of heritable variation in Hsp70 expression ranged between 0.25 and 0.49, and the association among variation in first- and third-instar larvae and in adults correlated highly. Thus, Hsp70 expression is genetically coupled at these developmental stages. A line engineered with extra copies of the hsp70 gene produced more Hsp70 and survived heat shock much better than did a control strain. Among natural lines, Hsp70 expression was only weakly related to tolerance of heat shock and to larva-to-adult survival and developmental time at permissive temperatures. Additionally, lines with high adult survival developed slowly as larvae, which is a possible trade-off. These and other findings suggest that trade-offs may maintain quantitative variation both in heatshock protein expression and in life-history traits that associate with thermotolerance.},

@article{dahlgaard1998,
	Abstract = {1. Inducible heat-shock proteins are synthesized when temperatures are increased to levels substantially above normal. The functional role of these proteins is well known at the cellular level. Today increasing interest has been directed towards the importance of heat-shock proteins for resistance of whole organisms to high-temperature stress and other environmental stressors.2. Here the functional relationship between the heat-shock protein, Hsp70, and thermal resistance in adult Drosophila melanogaster was examined by comparing thermal resistance, i.e. survival at 39 $\,^{\circ}$C for 85 min, and levels of Hsp70 at various times elapsed (2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 h) after thermotolerance was induced by short-term acclimation/heat hardening at 37 $\,^{\circ}$C for 55 min.3. Levels of Hsp70 in both males and females were highest 2 h after heat hardening and declined with longer times elapsed. The rate of decrease initially was very fast but diminished with increasing time. After 32 h the level of Hsp70 approached the level in flies that were not hardened. Levels of Hsp70 in males exceeded that of females during the entire period.4. Survival of both sexes increased with increasing time after heat hardening and reached an optimum between 8 and 32 h. Thereafter resistance decreased with longer times elapsed. Survival of females generally exceeded that of males except after 16 and 64 h.5. Regression analysis applied to the data on Hsp70 levels revealed that the model describing these data could not explain the data for survival. Also, higher levels of Hsp70 in males compared with females were not associated with greater survival in males. However, statistical analysis on paired measurements of Hsp70 and survival revealed a positive association between Hsp70 level and survival at each time elapsed after induction of thermotolerance.},

	Abstract = {Temperature adaptation is one of the most important determinants of distribution and population size of organisms in nature. Recently, quantitative trait loci ({QTL}) mapping and gene expression profiling approaches have been used for detecting candidate genes for heat resistance. However, the resolution of {QTL} mapping is not high enough to examine the individual effects of various genes in each {QTL}. Heat stress-responsive genes, characterized by gene expression profiling studies, are not necessarily responsible for heat resistance. Some of these genes may be regulated in association with the heat stress response of other genes.

	Abstract = {The ability to respond rapidly to changes in temperature is critical for insects and other ectotherms living in variable environments. In a physiological process termed rapid cold-hardening ({RCH}), exposure to nonlethal low temperature allows many insects to significantly increase their cold tolerance in a matter of minutes to hours. Additionally, there are rapid changes in gene expression and cell physiology during recovery from cold injury, and we hypothesize that {RCH} may modulate some of these processes during recovery. In this study, we used a combination of transcriptomics and metabolomics to examine the molecular mechanisms of {RCH} and cold shock recovery in the flesh fly, Sarcophaga bullata. Surprisingly, out of ∼15,000 expressed sequence tags ({ESTs}) measured, no transcripts were upregulated during {RCH}, and likewise {RCH} had a minimal effect on the transcript signature during recovery from cold shock. However, during recovery from cold shock, we observed differential expression of ∼1,400 {ESTs}, including a number of heat shock proteins, cytoskeletal components, and genes from several cell signaling pathways. In the metabolome, {RCH} had a slight yet significant effect on several metabolic pathways, while cold shock resulted in dramatic increases in gluconeogenesis, amino acid synthesis, and cryoprotective polyol synthesis. Several biochemical pathways showed congruence at both the transcript and metabolite levels, indicating that coordinated changes in gene expression and metabolism contribute to recovery from cold shock. Thus, while {RCH} had very minor effects on gene expression, recovery from cold shock elicits sweeping changes in gene expression and metabolism along numerous cell signaling and biochemical pathways.},

@article{hoekstra2013,
	Abstract = {Background Mutations that increase gene expression are predicted to increase energy allocation to transcription, translation and protein function. Despite an appreciation that energetic tradeoffs may constrain adaptation, the energetic costs of increased gene expression are challenging to quantify and thus easily ignored when modeling the evolution of gene expression, particularly for multicellular organisms. Here we use the well-characterized, inducible heat-shock response to test whether expressing additional copies of the Hsp70 gene increases energetic demand in Drosophila melanogaster. Results We measured metabolic rates of larvae with different copy numbers of the Hsp70 gene to quantify energy expenditure before, during, and after exposure to 36$\,^{\circ}$C, a temperature known to induce robust expression of Hsp70. We observed a rise in metabolic rate within the first 30 minutes of 36$\,^{\circ}$C exposure above and beyond the increase in routine metabolic rate at 36$\,^{\circ}$C. The magnitude of this increase in metabolic rate was positively correlated with Hsp70 gene copy number and reflected an increase as great as 35\% of the 22$\,^{\circ}$C metabolic rate. Gene copy number also affected Hsp70 {mRNA} levels as early as 15 minutes after larvae were placed at 36$\,^{\circ}$C, demonstrating that gene copy number affects transcript abundance on the same timescale as the metabolic effects that we observed. Inducing Hsp70 also had lasting physiological costs, as larvae had significantly depressed metabolic rate when returned to 22$\,^{\circ}$C after induction. Conclusions Our results demonstrate both immediate and persistent energetic consequences of gene copy number in a multicellular organism. We discuss these consequences in the context of existing literature on the pleiotropic effects of variation in Hsp70 copy number, and argue that the increased energetic demand of expressing extra copies of Hsp70 may contribute to known tradeoffs in physiological performance of extra-copy larvae. Physiological costs of mutations that greatly increase gene expression, such as these, may constrain their utility for adaptive evolution.},

To infer differential signal in such data correctly and with good statistical power, estimation of data variability throughout the dynamic range and a suitable error model are required.

	Abstract = {1. Terrestrial ectotherms are likely to face increased periods of heat stress as mean temperatures and temperature variability increase over the next few decades. Here, we consider the extent to which changes in upper thermal limits, through plasticity or evolution, might be constrained, and we survey insect and reptile data to identify groups likely to be particularly susceptible to thermal stress.2. Plastic changes increase thermal limits in many terrestrial ectotherms, but tend to have less effect on upper limits than lower limits.3. Although comparisons across insect species have normally not taken into account the potential for plastic responses, mid-latitude species seem most prone to experience heat stress now and into the future, consistent with data from lizards and other groups.4. Evolutionary adaptive potential has only been measured for some species; there is likely to be genetic variation for heat responses in populations, but selection and heritability experiments suggest that upper thermal limits may not increase much.5. Although related species can differ by several degrees in their upper thermal limits, there is strong phylogenetic signal for upper limits. If these reflect evolutionary constraints, substantial molecular changes may be required to increase upper thermal limits.6. Findings point to many terrestrial ectotherms having a limited potential to change their thermal limits particularly within the context of an average predicted temperature increase of 2--4 $\,^{\circ}$C for mid-latitude populations over the next few decades.},

	Abstract = {Aim Under the Hutchinsonian concept of the realized niche, biotic interactions and dispersal limitation may prevent species from fully occupying areas that they could tolerate physiologically. This can hamper the translation of physiological limits into climatically defined range limits and distorts inferences of evolutionary changes of the adaptive limits (i.e. niche conservatism). In contrast, heritable physiological limits should conform more closely to the position of the niche in the climatic hyperspace. Here, we hypothesize that a measure of niche position in the climatic hyperspace is more reliable than niche boundaries to capture the variability and evolutionary pattern of physiological tolerance. Location Neotropics and Palaeartic. Methods We used phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic regressions to test the relationships between physiological requirements and macroecological niche features (i.e. based on known species distributions) among anurans. We use larval critical thermal maximum ({CTmax}) as a measure of physiological response and maximum temperature (Tmax), temperature variability (Tvar) and the position and breadth of niche in climatic hyperspace as measures of the realized niche in geographical space. We also compare evolutionary rates among these parameters using the phylogenetic signal representation curve. Results {CTmax} is better correlated with niche position (r2 = 0.414) than with Tvar, and {CTmax} is unrelated to either Tmax or niche breadth. {CTmax} and macroecological niche position also show similar and rapid evolutionary rates, i.e. faster than Brownian motion, whereas Tmax and Tvar evolve more slowly and niche breadth evolves at random. Main conclusions The transferability between thermal tolerance and realized climatic niche limits is weak. Only macroecological niche position in the multivariate climatic hyperspace correlates with physiological tolerance. It thus appears to be more suitable for describing the variability and evolutionary pattern of the species' adaptive limits. We link these results to `niche dimensionality', in that multiple interacting factors outweigh single factors in demarcating the species' realized climatic niche, thereby determining the conserved upper thermal limits of the species.},

@article{goddard2007,
	Abstract = {Genomic selection is a form of marker-assisted selection in which genetic markers covering the whole genome are used so that all quantitative trait loci ({QTL}) are in linkage disequilibrium with at least one marker. This approach has become feasible thanks to the large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNP}) discovered by genome sequencing and new methods to efficiently genotype large number of {SNP}. Simulation results and limited experimental results suggest that breeding values can be predicted with high accuracy using genetic markers alone but more validation is required especially in samples of the population different from that in which the effect of the markers was estimated. The ideal method to estimate the breeding value from genomic data is to calculate the conditional mean of the breeding value given the genotype of the animal at each {QTL}. This conditional mean can only be calculated by using a prior distribution of {QTL} effects so this should be part of the research carried out to implement genomic selection. In practice, this method of estimating breeding values is approximated by using the marker genotypes instead of the {QTL} genotypes but the ideal method is likely to be approached more closely as more sequence and {SNP} data is obtained. Implementation of genomic selection is likely to have major implications for genetic evaluation systems and for genetic improvement programmes generally and these are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Understanding the evolution of reaction norms remains a major challenge in ecology and evolution. Investigating evolutionary divergence in reaction norm shapes between populations and closely related species is one approach to providing insights. Here we use a meta-analytic approach to compare divergence in reaction norms of closely related species or populations of animals and plants across types of traits and environments. We quantified mean-standardized differences in overall trait means (Offset) and reaction norm shape (including both Slope and Curvature). These analyses revealed that differences in shape (Slope and Curvature together) were generally greater than differences in Offset. Additionally, differences in Curvature were generally greater than differences in Slope. The type of taxon contrast (species vs. population), trait, organism, and the type and novelty of environments all contributed to the best-fitting models, especially for Offset, Curvature, and the total differences (Total) between reaction norms. Congeneric species had greater differences in reaction norms than populations, and novel environmental conditions increased the differences in reaction norms between populations or species. These results show that evolutionary divergence of curvature is common and should be considered an important aspect of plasticity, together with slope. Biological details about traits and environments, including cryptic variation expressed in novel environmental conditions, may be critical to understanding how reaction norms evolve in novel and rapidly changing environments.},

	Abstract = {High-throughput sequencing technologies have strongly impacted microbiology, providing a rapid and cost-effective way of generating draft genomes and exploring microbial diversity. However, sequences obtained from impure nucleic acid preparations may contain {DNA} from sources other than the sample. Those sequence contaminations are a serious concern to the quality of the data used for downstream analysis, causing misassembly of sequence contigs and erroneous conclusions. Therefore, the removal of sequence contaminants is a necessary and required step for all sequencing projects. We developed {DeconSeq}, a robust framework for the rapid, automated identification and removal of sequence contamination in longer-read datasets (150 bp mean read length). {DeconSeq} is publicly available as standalone and web-based versions. The results can be exported for subsequent analysis, and the databases used for the web-based version are automatically updated on a regular basis. {DeconSeq} categorizes possible contamination sequences, eliminates redundant hits with higher similarity to non-contaminant genomes, and provides graphical visualizations of the alignment results and classifications. Using {DeconSeq}, we conducted an analysis of possible human {DNA} contamination in 202 previously published microbial and viral metagenomes and found possible contamination in 145 (72\%) metagenomes with as high as 64\% contaminating sequences. This new framework allows scientists to automatically detect and efficiently remove unwanted sequence contamination from their datasets while eliminating critical limitations of current methods. {DeconSeq}'s web interface is simple and user-friendly. The standalone version allows offline analysis and integration into existing data processing pipelines. {DeconSeq}'s results reveal whether the sequencing experiment has succeeded, whether the correct sample was sequenced, and whether the sample contains any sequence contamination from {DNA} preparation or host. In addition, the analysis of 202 metagenomes demonstrated significant contamination of the non-human associated metagenomes, suggesting that this method is appropriate for screening all metagenomes. {DeconSeq} is available at http://deconseq.sourceforge.net/.},

	Abstract = {Temperature is a strong selective force on the evolution of proteins due to its effects on higher orders of protein structure and, thereby, on critical protein functions like ligand binding and catalysis. Comparisons among orthologous proteins from differently thermally adapted species show consistent patterns of adaptive variation in function, but few studies have examined functional adaptation among multiple structural families of proteins. Thus, with our present state of knowledge, it is difficult to predict what fraction of the proteome will exhibit adaptive variation in the face of temperature increases of a few to several degrees Celsius, that is, temperature increases of the magnitude predicted by models of global warming. Here, we compared orthologous enzymes of the warm-adapted Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis and the cold-adapted Mytilus trossulus, a native of the North Pacific Ocean, species whose physiologies exhibit significantly different responses to temperature. We measured the effects of temperature on the kinetics (Michaelis--Menten constant---Km) of five enzymes that are important for {ATP} generation and that represent distinct protein structural families. Among phosphoglucomutase ({PGM}), phosphoglucose isomerase ({PGI}), pyruvate kinase ({PK}), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase ({GTP}) ({PEPCK}), and isocitrate dehydrogenase ({NADP}) ({IDH}), only {IDH} orthologs showed significantly different thermal responses of Km between the two species. The Km of isocitrate of M. galloprovincialis-{IDH} was intrinsically lower and more thermally stable than that of M. trossulus-{IDH} and thus had higher substrate affinity at high temperatures. Two amino acid substitutions account for the functional differences between {IDH} orthologs, one of which allows for more hydrogen bonds to form near the mobile region of the active site in M. galloprovincialis-{IDH}. Taken together, our findings cast light on the targets of adaptive evolution in the context of climate change; only a minority of proteins might adapt to small changes in temperature, and these adaptations may involve only small changes in sequence.},

However, the importance of potential candidates is rarely followed up through functional studies and/or by comparing results across independent studies. We have analysed the overlap of candidate genes identified from studies of gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster using similar technical platforms. We found little overlap across studies between putative candidate genes for the same traits in the same sex. Instead there was a high degree of overlap between different traits and sexes within the same genetic backgrounds. Putative candidates found using transcriptomics therefore appear very sensitive to genetic background and this can mask or override effects of treatments. The functional importance of putative candidate genes emerging from transcriptome studies needs to be validated through additional experiments and in future studies we suggest a focus on the genes, networks and pathways affecting traits in a consistent manner across backgrounds.},

Different classes of tradeoffs are known to constrain the evolution of phenotypes, but current theories incorporate only a subset of these tradeoffs. Consequently, these theories cannot account for some of the variation in reaction norms that has been observed within and among species. Empirical studies of thermal reaction norms for physiological and life historical traits have shown that different proximate mechanisms can produce similar reaction norms. As a consequence, certain tradeoffs can be circumvented when the fitness costs imposed by these tradeoffs are severe. We argue that a unified theory that includes all classes of tradeoffs would provide a better understanding of the mechanisms that drive the evolution of reaction norms.},

When raised in a nonstressful environment, ancestral populations were highly sensitive to a 36.8$\,^{\circ}$ heat shock and exhibited high mortality. However, initial exposure to a nonlethal high temperature environment resulted in significantly reduced mortality during heat shock (hormesis). Lines selected for heat shock resistance rapidly evolved the capacity to withstand heat shock in the native environment without any initial exposure to high temperatures, and early exposure to high temperatures did not lead to further increases in heat resistance. This loss of plasticity would appear to have resulted from the genetic assimilation of the heat induction response in the noninducing environment. However, analyses of transcriptional variation via {RNA}-sequencing from the selected populations revealed no global changes in gene regulation correlated with the observed changes in heat stress resistance. Instead, assays of the phenotypic response across a broader range of temperatures revealed that the induced plasticity was not fixed across environments, but rather the threshold for the response was shifted to higher temperatures over evolutionary time. These results demonstrate that apparent genetic assimilation can result from shifting thresholds of induction across environments and that analysis of the broader environmental context is critically important for understanding the evolution of phenotypic plasticity.},

	Abstract = {The greater latitudinal extents of occurrence of species towards higher latitudes has been attributed to the broadening of physiological tolerances with latitude as a result of increases in climatic variation. While there is some support for such patterns in climate, the physiological tolerances of species across large latitudinal gradients have seldom been assessed. Here we report findings for insects based on published upper and lower lethal temperature data. The upper thermal limits show little geographical variation. In contrast, the lower bounds of supercooling points and lower lethal temperatures do indeed decline with latitude. However, this is not the case for the upper bounds, leading to an increase in the variation in lower lethal limits with latitude. These results provide some support for the physiological tolerance assumption associated with Rapoport's rule, but highlight the need for coupled data on species tolerances and range size.},

	Abstract = {Upper thermal limits vary less than lower limits among related species of terrestrial ectotherms. This pattern may reflect weak or uniform selection on upper limits, or alternatively tight evolutionary constraints. We investigated this issue in 94 Drosophila species from diverse climates and reared in a common environment to control for plastic effects that may confound species comparisons. We found substantial variation in upper thermal limits among species, negatively correlated with annual precipitation at the central point of their distribution and also with the interaction between precipitation and maximum temperature, showing that heat resistance is an important determinant of Drosophila species distributions. Species from hot and relatively dry regions had higher resistance, whereas resistance was uncorrelated with temperature in wetter regions. Using a suite of analyses we showed that phylogenetic signal in heat resistance reflects phylogenetic inertia rather than common selection pressures. Current species distributions are therefore more likely to reflect environmental sorting of lineages rather than local adaptation. Similar to previous studies, thermal safety margins were small at low latitudes, with safety margins smallest for species occupying both humid and dry tropical environments. Thus, species from a range of environments are likely to be at risk owing to climate change. Together these findings suggest that this group of insects is unlikely to buffer global change effects through marked evolutionary changes, highlighting the importance of facilitating range shifts for maintaining biodiversity.},

	Abstract = {The cellular heat stress response is well studied in Drosophila in respect to the role of heat shock proteins (Hsp). Hsps are molecular chaperones, highly expressed during and after exposure to numerous stress types. Hsps are all regulated by a common transcription factor, the heat shock factor ({HSF}), and it is known that {HSF} is controlling other, so far uncharacterised, heat-responsive genes. In this study, we investigate whether novel candidate genes for heat resistance, identified by microarray experiments, are regulated by {HSF}. The microarray experiments recently identified several strongly upregulated genes in response to a short, non-lethal heat treatment in Drosophila melanogaster. To test whether or not a subset of these genes are {HSF}-induced, we studied 11 currently unannotated genes using quantitative polymerase chain reaction on {HSF} mutant flies with a non-functional {HSF} at elevated temperatures. We found indication of {HSF} regulation in most of the studied genes, suggesting a role of these unknown genes in heat tolerance. Surprisingly, some of the genes seemed to be upregulated independent of {HSF} function. The high induction in response to heat, which mimics the expression profile of Hsps, implies a role in the cellular heat response of these genes as well.},

	Abstract = {Transcriptional profiling using {DNA} microarrays has become a widely used approach for identifying genes with important roles in stress-regulatory networks. In previous studies, genes exhibiting a plastic expression pattern with respect to stress and control treatments have been identified as candidates with putative roles in stress-response pathways. This approach, however, often identifies numerous genes, and it is difficult to discern which genes have major effects that impact the fitness of individuals under stress. In this study, we investigated the impacts of temperature stress (cold and heat) on gene expression in the Arabidopsis thaliana model system. We identified genes exhibiting plastic patterns of gene expression with respect to temperature stress, but in contrast to previous studies, we also considered the adaptive significance of genes by examining their expression patterns among 10 Arabidopsis ecotypes indigenous to a range of latitudes. Our findings support a general association between plasticity of gene expression and adaptive value. In comparison to non-plastic genes, genes exhibiting plastic expression patterns were associated with greater among-ecotype variation in expression levels, and such variation was more strongly correlated with geographical temperature gradients. Surprisingly, while more than 16 000 genes were associated with plastic expression patterns, significant evidence of both expression plasticity and adaptive value was obtained for only 43 genes. These selected genes represent strong candidates for future experimental investigations into the molecular basis of temperature acclimation in the A. thaliana model system.},

	Abstract = {Adaptation to a sudden extreme change in environment, beyond the usual range of background environmental fluctuations, is analysed using a quantitative genetic model of phenotypic plasticity. Generations are discrete, with time lag τ between a critical period for environmental influence on individual development and natural selection on adult phenotypes. The optimum phenotype, and genotypic norms of reaction, are linear functions of the environment. Reaction norm elevation and slope (plasticity) vary among genotypes. Initially, in the average background environment, the character is canalized with minimum genetic and phenotypic variance, and no correlation between reaction norm elevation and slope. The optimal plasticity is proportional to the predictability of environmental fluctuations over time lag τ. During the first generation in the new environment the mean fitness suddenly drops and the mean phenotype jumps towards the new optimum phenotype by plasticity. Subsequent adaptation occurs in two phases. Rapid evolution of increased plasticity allows the mean phenotype to closely approach the new optimum. The new phenotype then undergoes slow genetic assimilation, with reduction in plasticity compensated by genetic evolution of reaction norm elevation in the original environment.},

	Abstract = {Local adaptation of populations could preclude or slow range expansions in response to changing climate, particularly when dispersal is limited. To investigate the differential responses of populations to changing climatic conditions, we exposed poleward peripheral and central populations of two Lepidoptera to reciprocal, common-garden climatic conditions and compared their whole-transcriptome expression. We found evidence of simple population differentiation in both species, and in the species with previously identified population structure and phenotypic local adaptation, we found several hundred genes that responded in a synchronized and localized fashion. These genes were primarily involved in energy metabolism and oxidative stress, and expression levels were most divergent between populations in the same environment in which we previously detected divergence for metabolism. We found no localized genes in the species with less population structure and for which no local adaptation was previously detected. These results challenge the assumption that species are functionally similar across their ranges and poleward peripheral populations are preadapted to warmer conditions. Rather, some taxa deserve population-level consideration when predicting the effects of climate change because they respond in genetically based, distinctive ways to changing conditions.},

	Abstract = {Aim

Understanding the stability of realized niches is crucial for predicting the responses of species to climate change. One approach is to evaluate the niche differences of populations of the same species that occupy regions that are geographically disconnected. Here, we assess niche conservatism along thermal gradients for 26 plant species with a disjunct distribution between the Alps and the Arctic.


Location

European Alps and Norwegian Finnmark.


Methods

We collected a comprehensive dataset of 26 arctic-alpine plant occurrences in two regions. We assessed niche conservatism through a multispecies comparison and analysed species rankings at cold and warm thermal limits along two distinct gradients corresponding to (1) air temperatures at 2 m above ground level and (2) elevation distances to the tree line ({TLD}) for the two regions. We assessed whether observed relationships were close to those predicted under thermal limit conservatism.


Results

We found a weak similarity in species ranking at the warm thermal limits. The range of warm thermal limits for the 26 species was much larger in the Alps than in Finnmark. We found a stronger similarity in species ranking and correspondence at the cold thermal limit along the gradients of 2-m temperature and {TLD}. Yet along the 2-m temperature gradient the cold thermal limits of species in the Alps were lower on average than those in Finnmark.


Main conclusion

We found low conservatism of the warm thermal limits but a stronger conservatism of the cold thermal limits. We suggest that biotic interactions at the warm thermal limit are likely to modulate species responses more strongly than at the cold limit. The differing biotic context between the two regions is probably responsible for the observed differences in realized niches.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Antagonistic correlations among traits may slow the rate of adaptation to a changing environment. The tide pool copepod Tigriopus californicus is locally adapted to temperature, but within populations, the response to selection for increased heat tolerance plateaus rapidly, suggesting either limited variation within populations or costs of increased tolerance. To measure possible costs of thermal tolerance, we selected for increased upper lethal limits for 10 generations in 22 lines of T. californicus from six populations. Then, for each line, we measured six fitness-related traits. Selected lines showed an overall increase in male and female body sizes, fecundity, and starvation resistance, suggesting a small benefit from (rather than costs of) increased tolerance. The effect of selection on correlated traits also varied significantly by population for five traits, indicating that the genetic basis for the selection response differed among populations. Our results suggest that adaptation was limited by the presence of variation within isolated populations rather than by costs of increased tolerance.},

@article{gonzalez2013,
	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: High-throughput {RNA} sequencing studies are becoming increasingly popular and differential expression studies represent an important downstream analysis that often follow de novo transcriptome assembly. If a lot of attention has been given to bioinformatics tools for differential gene expression, little has yet been given to the impact of the sequence data itself used in pipelines.
{RESULTS}: We tested how using different types of reads from the ones used to assemble a de novo transcriptome (both differing in length and pairing attributes) could potentially affect differential expression ({DE}) results. To investigate this, we created artificial datasets out of long paired-end {RNA}-seq datasets initially used to build the assembly. All datasets were compared via {DE} analyses and because all samples come from the same sequencing run, {DE} of genes or isoforms can be interpreted as false positives resulting from sequence attributes. If the false positive rate for differential gene expression does not seem to be strongly affected by sequencing strategy (max. of 3.5\%), it could reach 12.2\% or 28.1\% for differential isoform expression depending of the pipeline used. The effect of paired-end vs. single-end strategy was found to have a much greater impact in terms of false positives than sequence length.
{CONCLUSION}: In light of false positive rate results, we recommend using paired-end over single-end sequences in differential expression studies, even if the impact is less serious for differential gene expression.},

	Abstract = {When faced with climate change, species must either shift their home range or adapt in situ in order to maintain optimal physiological balance with their environment. The American pika (Ochotona princeps) is a small alpine mammal with limited dispersal capacity and low tolerance for thermal stress. As a result, pikas have become an important system for examining biotic responses to changing climatic conditions. Previous research using amplified fragment length polymorphisms ({AFLPs}) has revealed evidence for environmental-mediated selection in O. princeps populations distributed along elevation gradients, yet the anonymity of {AFLP} loci and lack of available genomic resources precluded the identification of associated gene regions. Here, we harnessed next-generation sequencing technology in order to characterize the American pika transcriptome and identify a large suite of single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}), which can be used to elucidate elevation- and site-specific patterns of sequence variation.

	Abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that corals can acclimatize or adapt to local stress factors through differential regulation of their gene expression. Profiling gene expression in corals from diverse environments can elucidate the physiological processes that may be responsible for maximizing coral fitness in their natural habitat and lead to a better understanding of the coral's capacity to survive the effects of global climate change. In an accompanying paper, we show that Porites astreoides from thermally different reef habitats exhibit distinct physiological responses when exposed to 6 weeks of chronic temperature stress in a common garden experiment. Here, we describe expression profiles obtained from the same corals for a panel of 9 previously reported and 10 novel candidate stress response genes identified in a pilot {RNA}-Seq experiment. The strongest expression change was observed in a novel candidate gene potentially involved in calcification, {SLC}26, a member of the solute carrier family 26 anion exchangers, which was down-regulated by 92-fold in bleached corals relative to controls. The most notable signature of divergence between coral populations was constitutive up-regulation of metabolic genes in corals from the warmer inshore location, including the gluconeogenesis enzymes pyruvate carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and the lipid beta-oxidation enzyme acyl-{CoA} dehydrogenase. Our observations highlight several molecular pathways that were not previously implicated in the coral stress response and suggest that host management of energy budgets might play an adaptive role in holobiont thermotolerance.},

	Abstract = {Physiological thermal-tolerance limits of terrestrial ectotherms often exceed local air temperatures, implying a high degree of thermal safety (an excess of warm or cold thermal tolerance). However, air temperatures can be very different from the equilibrium body temperature of an individual ectotherm. Here, we compile thermal-tolerance limits of ectotherms across a wide range of latitudes and elevations and compare these thermal limits both to air and to operative body temperatures (theoretically equilibrated body temperatures) of small ectothermic animals during the warmest and coldest times of the year. We show that extreme operative body temperatures in exposed habitats match or exceed the physiological thermal limits of most ectotherms. Therefore, contrary to previous findings using air temperatures, most ectotherms do not have a physiological thermal-safety margin. They must therefore rely on behavior to avoid overheating during the warmest times, especially in the lowland tropics. Likewise, species living at temperate latitudes and in alpine habitats must retreat to avoid lethal cold exposure. Behavioral plasticity of habitat use and the energetic consequences of thermal retreats are therefore critical aspects of species' vulnerability to climate warming and extreme events.},

@article{padovan2013,
	Abstract = {Long-lived trees can accumulate mutations throughout their lifetimes that may influence biotic and abiotic interactions. For example, some Eucalyptus trees display marked variation in herbivore defence within a single canopy. These ``mosaic'' trees support foliage with distinct chemotypes which are differentially favoured by insect and vertebrate herbivores, resulting in susceptible and resistant branches within a single canopy. These mosaic trees provide a unique opportunity to explore the biosynthesis and genetic regulation of chemical defences in the foliage. The biosynthesis of the principal defence compounds, terpenoid-dominated essential oils, is well understood. However, the regulation of the genes involved and thus the control of phenotypic variation within a single tree canopy remains a mystery.

These analyses can identify the cellular loci and intensities of stress-induced perturbation and generate predictions about ecosystem alterations in a changing world. Congeneric species adapted to different abiotic conditions offer excellent study systems for these purposes. Several findings have emerged from such comparative studies: 1 ) In aquatic and terrestrial habitats, the most heat-tolerant ectotherms may be most threatened by further increases in temperature, due to proximity of these species' thermal optima and tolerance limits to current maximal ambient temperatures and limited capacities for acclimatization to higher temperatures. 2 ) Cardiac function is a ``weak link'' in acute thermal tolerance. 3 ) Stress-induced changes in gene expression comprise a graded response involving genes linked to damage repair, lysis of irreversibly damaged molecules, and downregulation of cell proliferation. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses provide ``biomarkers'' for diagnosing degrees of stress. 4 ) Different abiotic stresses may have synergistic or opposing effects on gene expression, a complexity needing consideration when developing integrated pictures of effects of global change. 5 ) Adaptation of proteins can result from one to a few amino acid substitutions, which can occur at many sites in a protein, a discovery with implications for rates of adaptive evolution. 6 ) Greater thermal tolerance of invasive species may favor their replacement of natives. 7 ) Losses of protein-coding genes and temperature-responsive gene regulatory abilities in stenothermal ectotherms of the Southern Ocean may lead to broad extinctions.},

Selection acts upon individual differences within a population. Whether individual differences within a natural population include variation in gene expression levels has not yet been addressed on a genome-wide scale. Here we use {DNA} microarray technology for measuring comparative gene expression and a refined statistical analysis for the purpose of comparing gene expression levels in natural isolates of the wine yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A method for the Bayesian analysis of gene expression levels is used to compare four natural isolates of S. cerevisiae from Montalcino, Italy. Widespread variation in amino acid metabolism, sulfur assimilation and processing, and protein degradation---primarily consisting of differences in expression level smaller than a factor of 2---is demonstrated. Genetic variation in gene expression among isolates from a natural population is present on a genomic scale. It remains to be determined what role differential gene expression may play in adaptation to new or changing environments.},

Overall, we found that electronic annotations are more reliable than generally believed, to an extent that they are competitive with annotations inferred by curators when they use evidence other than experiments from primary literature. But we also report significant variations among inference methods, types of annotations, and organisms. This work provides guidance for Gene Ontology users and lays the foundations for improving computational approaches to {GO} function inference.},

	Abstract = {Recent advances in molecular technologies have opened up unprecedented opportunities for molecular ecologists to better understand the molecular basis of traits of ecological and evolutionary importance in almost any organism. Nevertheless, reliable and systematic inference of functionally relevant information from these masses of data remains challenging. The aim of this review is to highlight how the Gene Ontology ({GO}) database can be of use in resolving this challenge. The {GO} provides a largely species-neutral source of information on the molecular function, biological role and cellular location of tens of thousands of gene products. As it is designed to be species-neutral, the {GO} is well suited for cross-species use, meaning that, functional annotation derived from model organisms can be transferred to inferred orthologues in newly sequenced species. In other words, the {GO} can provide gene annotation information for species with nonannotated genomes. In this review, we describe the {GO} database, how functional information is linked with genes/gene products in model organisms, and how molecular ecologists can utilize this information to annotate their own data. Then, we outline various applications of {GO} for enhancing the understanding of molecular basis of traits in ecologically relevant species. We also highlight potential pitfalls, provide step-by-step recommendations for conducting a sound study in nonmodel organisms, suggest avenues for future research and outline a strategy for maximizing the benefits of a more ecological and evolutionary genomics-oriented ontology by ensuring its compatibility with the {GO}.},

	Abstract = {Biological cells are extremely sensitive to temperature. What is the mechanism? We compute the thermal stabilities of the whole proteomes of Escherichia coli, yeast, and Caenorhabditis elegans using an analytical model and an extensive database of stabilities of individual proteins. Our results support the hypothesis that a cell's thermal sensitivities arise from the collective instability of its proteins. This model shows a denaturation catastrophe at temperatures of 49--55$\,^{\circ}$C, roughly the thermal death point of mesophiles. Cells live on the edge of a proteostasis catastrophe. According to the model, it is not that the average protein is problematic; it is the tail of the distribution. About 650 of E. coli's 4300 proteins are less than 4 kcal mol−1 stable to denaturation. And upshifting by only 4$\,^{\circ}$ from 37$\,^{\circ}$ to 41$\,^{\circ}$C is estimated to destabilize an average protein by nearly 20\%. This model also treats effects of denaturants, osmolytes, and other physical stressors. In addition, it predicts the dependence of cellular growth rates on temperature. This approach may be useful for studying physical forces in biological evolution and the role of climate change on biology.},

Our models consider both spatial variation (hard and soft selection) and temporal variation (within a generation and between generations).

When genetic constraints limit the types of evolutionary changes available to a reaction norm, different forms of environmental variation can also produce different evolutionary equilibria.

	Abstract = {Metabolism provides a basis for using first principles of physics, chemistry, and biology to link the biology of individual organisms to the ecology of populations, communities, and ecosystems. Metabolic rate, the rate at which organisms take up, transform, and expend energy and materials, is the most fundamental biological rate. We have developed a quantitative theory for how metabolic rate varies with body size and temperature. Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere. Examples include: (1) life history attributes, including development rate, mortality rate, age at maturity, life span, and population growth rate; (2) population interactions, including carrying capacity, rates of competition and predation, and patterns of species diversity; and (3) ecosystem processes, including rates of biomass production and respiration and patterns of trophic dynamics. Data compiled from the ecological literature strongly support the theoretical predictions. Eventually, metabolic theory may provide a conceptual foundation for much of ecology, just as genetic theory provides a foundation for much of evolutionary biology.},

@article{wardle2010,
	Abstract = {Despite their ubiquity, the role of ants in driving ecosystem processes both aboveground and belowground has been seldom explored, except within the nest. During 1995 we established 16 ant exclusion plots of approximately 1.1 × 1.1 m, together with paired control plots, in the understory layer of a boreal forest ecosystem in northern Sweden that supports high densities of the mound-forming ant Formica aquilonia, a red wood ant species of the Formica rufa group. Aboveground and belowground measurements were then made on destructively sampled subplots in 2001 and 2008, i.e., 6 and 13 years after set-up. While ant exclusion had no effect on total understory plant biomass, it did greatly increase the relative contribution of herbaceous species, most likely through preventing ants from removing their seeds. This in turn led to higher quality resources entering the belowground subsystem, which in turn stimulated soil microbial biomass and activity and the rates of loss of mass and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) from litter in litterbags placed in the plots. This was accompanied by losses of ∼15\% of N and C stored in the humus on a per area basis. Ant exclusion also had some effects on foliar stable isotope ratios for both C and N, most probably as a consequence of greater soil fertility. Further, exclusion of ants had multitrophic effects on a microbe--nematode soil food web with three consumer trophic levels and after six years promoted the bacterial-based relative to the fungal-based energy channel in this food web. Our results point to a major role of red wood ants in determining forest floor vegetation and thereby exerting wide-ranging effects on belowground properties and processes. Given that the boreal forest occupies 11\% of the Earth's terrestrial surface and stores more C than any other forest biome, our results suggest that this role of ants could potentially be of widespread significance for biogeochemical nutrient cycling, soil nutrient capital, and sequestration of belowground carbon.},

	Abstract = {Effects of climate warming on wild populations of organisms are expected to be greatest at higher latitudes, paralleling greater anticipated increases in temperature in these regions. Yet, these expectations assume that populations in different regions are equally susceptible to the effects of warming. This is unlikely to be the case. Here, we develop a series of predictive models for physiological thermal tolerances in ants based on current and future climates. We found that tropical ants have lower warming tolerances, a metric of susceptibility to climate warming, than temperate ants despite greater increases in temperature at higher latitudes. Using climatic, ecological and phylogenetic data, we refine our predictions of which ants (across all regions) were most susceptible to climate warming. We found that ants occupying warmer and more mesic forested habitats at lower elevations are the most physiologically susceptible to deleterious effects of climate warming. Phylogenetic history was also a strong indicator of physiological susceptibility. In short, we find that ants that live in the canopies of hot, tropical forest are the most at risk, globally, from climate warming. Unfortunately this is where many, perhaps most, ant and other species on Earth live.},

These lists are then further scrutinized to annotate these regions by gene function, corresponding biological processes, expression levels, or gene networks. Such annotations are often used to assess and/or verify the validity of the genome scan and the statistical methods that have been used to perform the analyses. Furthermore, these results are frequently considered to validate ``true-positives'' if the identified regions make biological sense a posteriori. Here, we show that this approach can be potentially misleading. By simulating neutral evolutionary histories, we demonstrate that it is possible not only to obtain an extremely high false-positive rate but also to make biological sense out of the false-positives and construct a sensible biological narrative. Results are compared with a recent polymorphism data set from Drosophila melanogaster.},

	Abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity is predicted to facilitate individual survival and/or evolve in response to novel environments. Plasticity that facilitates survival should both permit colonization and act as a buffer against further evolution, with contemporary and derived forms predicted to be similarly plastic for a suite of traits. On the other hand, given the importance of plasticity in maintaining internal homeostasis, derived populations that encounter greater environmental heterogeneity should evolve greater plasticity. We tested the evolutionary significance of phenotypic plasticity in coastal British Columbian postglacial populations of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) that evolved under greater seasonal extremes in temperature after invading freshwater lakes from the sea. Two ancestral (contemporary marine) and two derived (contemporary freshwater) populations of stickleback were raised near their thermal tolerance extremes, 7 and 22 $\,^{\circ}$C. Gene expression plasticity was estimated for more than 14 000 genes. Over five thousand genes were similarly plastic in marine and freshwater stickleback, but freshwater populations exhibited significantly more genes with plastic expression than marine populations. Furthermore, several of the loci shown to exhibit gene expression plasticity have been previously implicated in the adaptive evolution of freshwater populations, including a gene involved in mitochondrial regulation ({PPARAa}). Collectively, these data provide molecular evidence that highlights the importance of plasticity in colonization and adaptation to new environments.},

	Abstract = {Ants are ubiquitous members of most forest communities, where they disperse seeds, prey on other species, and influence the flow of nutrients. Their effects are often described as substantial, but few studies to date have simultaneously examined how the presence of ants affects both above and belowground processes. In this study, we experimentally reduced ant abundance in a suite of deciduous forest plots in northern Georgia, {USA} to assess the effects of ants on the spatial distribution of a common understory plant species, Hexastlylis arifolia, the structure of soil mesofaunal communities, and soil nitrogen dynamics. Over the course of several years, the removal of ants led to significant spatial aggregation of H. arifolia seedlings near the parent plant, most likely due to the absence of the keystone seed dispersal species, Aphaenogaster rudis. Seedling emergence was higher in ant removal plots, but seedling aggregation did not affect first or second year seedling mortality. Ammonium concentrations were 10× higher in ant removal plots relative to control plots where ants were present in the first year of the study, but this increase disappeared in the second and third years of the study. The effects of ant removal on the soil mesofauna were mixed: removal of ants apparently did not affect the abundance of Collembola, but the abundance of oribatid mites was significantly higher in ant removal plots by year two of the study. Taken together, these results provide some of the first experimental evidence of the diverse direct and indirect effects of ants on both above and belowground processes in forest ecosystems and demonstrate the potential consequences of losing an important seed dispersing ant species for the plants they disperse.},

	Abstract = {Earthworms, termites, and ants are common macroinvertebrates in terrestrial environments, although for most ecosystems data on their abundance and biomass is sparse. Quantifying their areal abundance is a critical first step in understanding their functional importance. We intensively sampled dead wood, litter, and soil in eastern {US} temperate hardwood forests at four sites, which span much of the latitudinal range of this ecosystem, to estimate the abundance and biomass m−2 of individuals in macroinvertebrate communities. Macroinvertebrates, other than ants and termites, differed only slightly among sites in total abundance and biomass and they were similar in ordinal composition. Termites and ants were the most abundant macroinvertebrates in dead wood, and ants were the most abundant in litter and soil. Ant abundance and biomass m−2 in the southernmost site (Florida) were among the highest values recorded for ants in any ecosystem. Ant and termite biomass and abundance varied greatly across the range, from {\textless}1\% of the total macroinvertebrate abundance (in the northern sites) to {\textgreater}95\% in the southern sites. Our data reveal a pronounced shift to eusocial insect dominance with decreasing latitude in a temperate ecosystem. The extraordinarily high social insect relative abundance outside of the tropics lends support to existing data suggesting that ants, along with termites, are globally the most abundant soil macroinvertebrates, and surpass the majority of other terrestrial animal (vertebrate and invertebrate) groups in biomass m−2. Our results provide a foundation for improving our understanding of the functional role of social insects in regulating ecosystem processes in temperate forest.},

	Abstract = {Ant-dispersed herbs (myrmecochores) can account for more than one-third of the stems in the temperate deciduous forests of eastern North America. Because many ant species have been observed collecting the seeds, this interaction is often described as a generalized mutualism. Here, we combine fieldwork and meta-analyses to test this assumption. Our meta-analysis demonstrated that Aphaenogaster ants (predominantly A. rudis) collect approximately 74$\pm$26\% (mean$\pm${SD}) of the myrmecochorous seeds in eastern North American forests where any encounters with Aphaenogaster were reported, and approximately 61$\pm$37\% of the seeds in all the eastern forests where any seed collection has been monitored. This remarkable monopolization of seeds is due to at least two factors: 1) Aphaenogaster are significantly more likely to collect the ant-adapted seeds they discover than are ten other ant genera found in these forests and 2) the densities of Aphaenogaster and myrmecochorous plants are positively correlated at three nested spatial scales (within 20×20 m patches, among patches within a forest, and among 41 forests in the eastern United States). Although other ants can collect seeds, our analyses demonstrate that A. rudis is the primary seed dispersal vector for most of this rich temperate ant-dispersed flora. The low levels of plant partner diversity for myrmecochores demonstrated here rivals that of tropical ant-plants (myrmecophytes) and well exceeds that typically observed in temperate plant--frugivore and plant--pollinator mutualisms and myrmecochory in other biomes.},

	Abstract = {No organism can survive across the entire temperature range found in the biosphere, and a given species can rarely support active metabolism across more than a few tens of $\,^{\circ}$C. Nevertheless, life can be maintained at surprisingly extreme temperatures, from below −50 to over 110$\,^{\circ}$C. That proteins, which are assembled with the same 20 amino acids in all species, can function well at both extremes of this range illustrates the plasticity available in the construction of these macromolecules. In studying proteins from extremophiles, researchers have found no new amino acids, covalent modifications or structural motifs that explain the ability of these molecules to function in such harsh environments. Rather, subtle redistributions of the same intramolecular interactions required for protein stabilization at moderate temperatures are sufficient to maintain structural integrity at hot or cold extremes. The key to protein function, whether in polar seas or hot springs, is the maintenance of an appropriate balance between molecular stability on the one hand and structural flexibility on the other. Stability is needed to ensure the appropriate geometry for ligand binding, as well as to avoid denaturation, while flexibility is necessary to allow catalysis at a metabolically appropriate rate. Comparisons of homologous proteins from organisms spanning a wide range of thermal habitats show that adaptive mutations, as well as stabilizing solutes, maintain a balance between these two attributes, regardless of the temperature at which the protein functions.},

	Abstract = {Individuals of two species of blue mussels,Mytilus trossulus (Gould, 1850) {andM}. galloprovincialis (Lamarck, 1819), that have different latitudinal distributions, were collected from two locations on the Pacific coast of the {USA} where their distributions do not overlap. To determine if the congeners were differentially sensitive to thermal stress, we first held individuals of each species at 13$\,^{\circ}$C for 8 wk and then examined three biochemical indices of thermal damage to cellular proteins: relative levels of the stress protein hsp 70, quantities of ubiquitin conjugates and the induction of stress-protein synthesis. The results provide evidence that the northern species,M. trossulus, was more thermally sensitive than the southern species,M. galloprovincialis. Relative levels of hsp 70 and amounts of ubiquitin conjugates were higher in gill tissue {fromM}. trossulus than in gill {fromM}. galloprovincialis, which suggests {thatM}. trossulus was more susceptible to reversible and irreversible protein damage, respectively, {thanM}. galloprovincialis. In addition, the patterns of stress-protein expression as measured by in vitro radiolabeling experiments using isolated gill tissue, were significantly different, as follows: (1) the threshold induction temperatures for hsp 70 synthesis were 23 and 25$\,^{\circ}$C {forM}. trossulus {andM}. galloprovincialis, respectively; (2) the overall intensity of synthesis and induction was greater {inM}. galloprovincialis than {inM}. trossulus, particularly at the higher incubation temperatures of 28 and 30$\,^{\circ}$C; (3)M. galloprovincialis expressed a 30 kdalton, stress protein that was not induced in the northern species,M. trossulus. Thus, after an 8 wk exposure to a common temperature, the twoedulis-like mussel congeners appeared to be physiologically distinct with respect to thermal damage to proteins. Due to the energetic cost that is probably associated with environmentally-induced protein damage and maintaining pools of stress proteins, differential organismal thermotolerances and protein stabilites may contribute to setting species distribution-limits. Our data support conclusions of other workers {thatM}. trossulus is a more cold-adapted species {thanM}. galloprovincialis.},

	Abstract = {To determine how the accumulation of the major Drosophila melanogaster heat-shock protein, Hsp70, affects inducible thermotolerance in larvae and pupae, we have compared two sister strains generated by site-specific homologus recombination. One strain carried 12 extra copies of the Hsp70 gene at a single insertion site (extra-copy strain) and the other carried remnants of the transgene construct but lacked the extra copies of Hsp70 (excision strain). Hsp70 levels in whole-body lysates of larvae and pupae were measured by {ELISA} with an Hsp70-specific antibody. In both extra-copy and excision strains, Hsp70 was undetectable prior to heat shock. Hsp70 concentrations were higher in the extra-copy strain than in the excision strain at most time points during and after heat shock. Pretreatment (i.e. exposure to 36 degrees C before heat shock) significantly improved thermotolerance, and this improvement was greater and more rapid in larvae and pupae of the extra-copy strain than in those of the excision strain. The experimental conditions resemble thermal regimes actually experienced by Drosophila in the field. Thus, these findings represent the best evidence to date that the amount of a heat-shock protein affects the fitness of a complex animal in the wild.},

	Abstract = {Molecular chaperones, including the heat-shock proteins (Hsps), are a ubiquitous feature of cells in which these proteins cope with stress-induced denaturation of other proteins. Hsps have received the most attention in model organisms undergoing experimental stress in the laboratory, and the function of Hsps at the molecular and cellular level is becoming well understood in this context. A complementary focus is now emerging on the Hsps of both model and nonmodel organisms undergoing stress in nature, on the roles of Hsps in the stress physiology of whole multicellular eukaryotes and the tissues and organs they comprise, and on the ecological and evolutionary correlates of variation in Hsps and the genes that encode them. This focus discloses that (a) expression of Hsps can occur in nature, (b) all species have hsp genes but they vary in the patterns of their expression, (c) Hsp expression can be correlated with resistance to stress, and (d) species' thresholds for Hsp expression are correlated with levels of stress that they naturally undergo. These conclusions are now well established and may require little additional confirmation; many significant questions remain unanswered concerning both the mechanisms of Hsp-mediated stress tolerance at the organismal level and the evolutionary mechanisms that have diversified the hsp genes.},

	Abstract = {Environmental and hormonal regulators of diapause have been reasonably well defined, but our understanding of the molecular regulation of diapause remains in its infancy. Though many genes are shut down during diapause, others are specifically expressed at this time. Classes of diapause-upregulated genes can be distinguished based on their expression patterns: Some are upregulated throughout diapause, and others are expressed only in early diapause, late diapause, or intermittently throughout diapause. The termination of diapause is accompanied by a rapid decline in expression of the diapause-upregulated genes and, conversely, an elevation in expression of many genes that were downregulated during diapause. A comparison of insect diapause with other forms of dormancy in plants and animals suggests that upregulation of a subset of heat shock protein genes may be one feature common to different types of dormancies.},

However, natural evolution is complex: random noise, historical accidents and ignorance of the selection pressures at work during adaptation all cloud comparative studies. Here, we review how adaptation in the laboratory by directed evolution can complement studies of natural enzymes in the effort to understand stability and function. Laboratory evolution experiments can attempt to mimic natural evolution and identify different adaptive mechanisms. However, laboratory evolution might make its biggest contribution in explorations of nonnatural functions, by allowing us to distinguish the properties nutured by evolution from those dictated by the laws of physical chemistry.},
