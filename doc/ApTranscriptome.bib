	abstract = {Motivation: The result of a typical microarray experiment is a long list of genes with corresponding expression measurements. This list is only the starting point for a meaningful biological interpretation. Modern methods identify relevant biological processes or functions from gene expression data by scoring the statistical significance of predefined functional gene groups, e.g. based on Gene Ontology {(GO).} We develop methods that increase the explanatory power of this approach by integrating knowledge about relationships between the {GO} terms into the calculation of the statistical significance.
Results: We present two novel algorithms that improve {GO} group scoring using the underlying {GO} graph topology. The algorithms are evaluated on real and simulated gene expression data. We show that both methods eliminate local dependencies between {GO} terms and point to relevant areas in the {GO} graph that remain undetected with state-of-the-art algorithms for scoring functional terms. A simulation study demonstrates that the new methods exhibit a higher level of detecting relevant biological terms than competing methods.

	abstract = {Determining how species' geographic ranges are governed by current climates and how they will respond to rapid climatic change poses a major biological challenge. Geographic ranges are often spatially fragmented and composed of genetically differentiated populations that are locally adapted to different thermal regimes. Tradeoffs between different aspects of thermal performance, such as between tolerance to high temperature and tolerance to low temperature or between maximal performance and breadth of performance, suggest that the performance of a given population will be a subset of that of the species. Therefore, species-level projections of distribution might overestimate the species' ability to persist at any given location. However, current approaches to modeling distributions often do not consider variation among populations. Here, we estimated genetically-based differences in thermal performance curves for growth among 12 populations of the scarlet monkeyflower, Mimulus cardinalis, a perennial herb of western North America. We inferred the maximum relative growth rate {(RGR(max))}, temperature optimum {(T(opt))}, and temperature breadth {(T(breadth))} for each population. We used these data to test for tradeoffs in thermal performance, generate mechanistic population-level projections of distribution under current and future climates, and examine how variation in aspects of thermal performance influences forecasts of range shifts. Populations differed significantly in {RGR(max)} and had variable, but overlapping, estimates of T(opt) and T(breadth). T(opt) declined with latitude and increased with temperature of origin, consistent with tradeoffs between performances at low temperatures versus those at high temperatures. Further, T(breadth) was negatively related to {RGR(max)}, as expected for a specialist-generalist tradeoff. Parameters of the thermal performance curve influenced properties of projected distributions. For both current and future climates, T(opt) was negatively related to latitudinal position, while T(breadth) was positively related to projected range size. The magnitude and direction of range shifts also varied with T(opt) and T(breadth), but sometimes in unexpected ways. For example, the fraction of habitat remaining suitable increased with T(opt) but decreased with T(breadth). Northern limits of all populations were projected to shift north, but the magnitude of shift decreased with T(opt) and increased with T(breadth). Median latitude was projected to shift north for populations with high T(breadth) and low T(opt), but south for populations with low T(breadth) and high T(opt). Distributions inferred by integrating population-level projections did not differ from a species-level projection that ignored variation among populations. However, the species-level approach masked the potential array of divergent responses by populations that might lead to genotypic sorting within the species' range. Thermal performance tradeoffs among populations within the species' range had important, but sometimes counterintuitive, effects on projected responses to climatic change.},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the {FWER} when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the {FWER} is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

This assumes that an organism{\textquoteright}s preferred body temperature corresponds with the thermal optimum in which performance is maximized; hence, shifts in thermal preferences affect the subsequent evolution of thermal-related traits. Drosophila subobscura evolved worldwide latitudinal clines in several traits including chromosome inversion frequencies, with some polymorphic inversions being apparently associated with thermal preference and thermal tolerance. Here we show that flies carrying the warm-climate chromosome arrangement O3+4 have higher basal protein levels of Hsp70 than their cold-climate Ost counterparts, but this difference disappears after heat hardening. O3+4 carriers are also more heat tolerant, although it is difficult to conclude from our results that this is causally linked to their higher basal levels of Hsp70. The observed patterns are consistent with the thermal co-adaptation hypothesis and suggest that the interplay between behaviour and physiology underlies latitudinal and seasonal shifts in inversion frequencies.},

Should ecologists prefer experiments with few treatments and many replicates analyzed with {ANOVA}, or experiments with many treatments and few replicates per treatment analyzed with regression?

The functional role of these proteins is well known at the cellular level. Today increasing interest has been directed towards the importance of heat-shock proteins for resistance of whole organisms to high-temperature stress and other environmental stressors.2. Here the functional relationship between the heat-shock protein, Hsp70, and thermal resistance in adult Drosophila melanogaster was examined by comparing thermal resistance, i.e. survival at 39 {{\textdegree}C} for 85 min, and levels of Hsp70 at various times elapsed (2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 h) after thermotolerance was induced by short-term acclimation/heat hardening at 37 {{\textdegree}C} for 55 min.3. Levels of Hsp70 in both males and females were highest 2 h after heat hardening and declined with longer times elapsed. The rate of decrease initially was very fast but diminished with increasing time. After 32 h the level of Hsp70 approached the level in flies that were not hardened. Levels of Hsp70 in males exceeded that of females during the entire period.4. Survival of both sexes increased with increasing time after heat hardening and reached an optimum between 8 and 32 h. Thereafter resistance decreased with longer times elapsed. Survival of females generally exceeded that of males except after 16 and 64 h.5. Regression analysis applied to the data on Hsp70 levels revealed that the model describing these data could not explain the data for survival. Also, higher levels of Hsp70 in males compared with females were not associated with greater survival in males. However, statistical analysis on paired measurements of Hsp70 and survival revealed a positive association between Hsp70 level and survival at each time elapsed after induction of thermotolerance.},

	abstract = {The impact of anthropogenic climate change on terrestrial organisms is often predicted to increase with latitude, in parallel with the rate of warming. Yet the biological impact of rising temperatures also depends on the physiological sensitivity of organisms to temperature change. We integrate empirical fitness curves describing the thermal tolerance of terrestrial insects from around the world with the projected geographic distribution of climate change for the next century to estimate the direct impact of warming on insect fitness across latitude. The results show that warming in the tropics, although relatively small in magnitude, is likely to have the most deleterious consequences because tropical insects are relatively sensitive to temperature change and are currently living very close to their optimal temperature. In contrast, species at higher latitudes have broader thermal tolerance and are living in climates that are currently cooler than their physiological optima, so that warming may even enhance their fitness. Available thermal tolerance data for several vertebrate taxa exhibit similar patterns, suggesting that these results are general for terrestrial ectotherms. Our analyses imply that, in the absence of ameliorating factors such as migration and adaptation, the greatest extinction risks from global warming may be in the tropics, where biological diversity is also greatest.},

	abstract = {Marine organisms are commonly exposed to variable environmental conditions, and many of them are under threat from increased sea temperatures caused by global climate change. Generating transcriptomic resources under different stress conditions are crucial for understanding molecular mechanisms underlying thermal adaptation. In this study, we conducted transcriptome-wide gene expression profiling of the scallop Chlamys farreri challenged by acute and chronic heat stress. Of the 13 953 unique tags, more than 850 were significantly differentially expressed at each time point after acute heat stress, which was more than the number of tags differentially expressed (320{\textendash}350) under chronic heat stress. To obtain a systemic view of gene expression alterations during thermal stress, a weighted gene coexpression network was constructed. Six modules were identified as acute heat stress-responsive modules. Among them, four modules involved in apoptosis regulation, {mRNA} binding, mitochondrial envelope formation and oxidation reduction were downregulated. The remaining two modules were upregulated. One was enriched with chaperone and the other with microsatellite sequences, whose coexpression may originate from a transcription factor binding site. These results indicated that C. farreri triggered several cellular processes to acclimate to elevated temperature. No modules responded to chronic heat stress, suggesting that the scallops might have acclimated to elevated temperature within 3 days. This study represents the first sequencing-based gene network analysis in a nonmodel aquatic species and provides valuable gene resources for the study of thermal adaptation, which should assist in the development of heat-tolerant scallop lines for aquaculture.},

Long-term studies have shown that the traits of individual mammals and birds are associated with their reproductive success, but little is known about the evolutionary ecology of collective behaviour in natural populations. An ant colony operates without central control, regulating its activity through a network of local interactions. This work shows that variation among harvester ant {(Pogonomyrmex} barbatus) colonies in collective response to changing conditions is related to variation in colony lifetime reproductive success in the production of offspring colonies. Desiccation costs are high for harvester ants foraging in the desert. More successful colonies tend to forage less when conditions are dry, and show relatively stable foraging activity when conditions are more humid. Restraint from foraging does not compromise a colony/'s long-term survival; colonies that fail to forage at all on many days survive as long, over the colony/'s 20-30-year lifespan, as those that forage more regularly. Sensitivity to conditions in which to reduce foraging activity may be transmissible from parent to offspring colony. These results indicate that natural selection is shaping the collective behaviour that regulates foraging activity, and that the selection pressure, related to climate, may grow stronger if the current drought in their habitat persists.},

This can hamper the translation of physiological limits into climatically defined range limits and distorts inferences of evolutionary changes of the adaptive limits (i.e. niche conservatism). In contrast, heritable physiological limits should conform more closely to the position of the niche in the climatic hyperspace. Here, we hypothesize that a measure of niche position in the climatic hyperspace is more reliable than niche boundaries to capture the variability and evolutionary pattern of physiological tolerance. Location Neotropics and Palaeartic. Methods We used phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic regressions to test the relationships between physiological requirements and macroecological niche features (i.e. based on known species distributions) among anurans. We use larval critical thermal maximum {(CTmax)} as a measure of physiological response and maximum temperature {(Tmax)}, temperature variability {(Tvar)} and the position and breadth of niche in climatic hyperspace as measures of the realized niche in geographical space. We also compare evolutionary rates among these parameters using the phylogenetic signal representation curve. Results {CTmax} is better correlated with niche position (r2 = 0.414) than with Tvar, and {CTmax} is unrelated to either Tmax or niche breadth. {CTmax} and macroecological niche position also show similar and rapid evolutionary rates, i.e. faster than Brownian motion, whereas Tmax and Tvar evolve more slowly and niche breadth evolves at random. Main conclusions The transferability between thermal tolerance and realized climatic niche limits is weak. Only macroecological niche position in the multivariate climatic hyperspace correlates with physiological tolerance. It thus appears to be more suitable for describing the variability and evolutionary pattern of the species' adaptive limits. We link these results to {\textquoteleft}niche dimensionality{\textquoteright}, in that multiple interacting factors outweigh single factors in demarcating the species' realized climatic niche, thereby determining the conserved upper thermal limits of the species.},

Exploring Gene Ontology {(GO)} annotations for such lists of genes has become a widespread practice to get first insights into the potential biological meaning of the experiment. The standard statistical approach to measuring overrepresentation of {GO} terms cannot cope with the dependencies resulting from the structure of {GO} because they analyze each term in isolation. Especially the fact that annotations are inherited from more specific descendant terms can result in certain types of false-positive results with potentially misleading biological interpretation, a phenomenon which we term the inheritance problem.
Results: We present here a novel approach to analysis of {GO} term overrepresentation that determines overrepresentation of terms in the context of annotations to the term's parents. This approach reduces the dependencies between the individual term's measurements, and thereby avoids producing false-positive results owing to the inheritance problem. {ROC} analysis using study sets with overrepresented {GO} terms showed a clear advantage for our approach over the standard algorithm with respect to the inheritance problem. Although there can be no gold standard for exploratory methods such as analysis of {GO} term overrepresentation, analysis of biological datasets suggests that our algorithm tends to identify the core {GO} terms that are most characteristic of the dataset being analyzed.

	abstract = {* Climate change will increase both average temperatures and extreme summer temperatures. Analyses of the fitness consequences of climate change have generally omitted negative fitness and population declines associated with heat stress. * Here, we examine how seasonal and interannual temperature variability will impact fitness shifts of ectotherms from the past (1961{\textendash}1990) to future (2071{\textendash}2100), by modelling thermal performance curves {(TPCs)} for insect species across latitudes. * In temperate regions, climate change increased the length of the growing season (increasing fitness) and increased the frequency of heat stress (decreasing fitness). Consequently, species at mid-latitudes (20{\textendash}40{\textdegree}) showed pronounced but heterogeneous responses to climate change. Fitness decreases for these species were accompanied by greater interannual variation in fitness. An alternative {TPC} model and a larger data set gave qualitatively similar results. * How close maximum summer temperatures are to the critical thermal maximum of a species {\textendash} the thermal buffer {\textendash} is a good predictor of the change in mean fitness expected under climate change. Thermal buffers will decrease to near or below zero by 2100 for many tropical and mid-latitude species. * Our forecasts suggest that mid-latitude species will be particularly susceptible to heat stress associated with climate change due to temperature variation.},

We have characterized variation in first-instar larvae of 20 isofemale lines isolated from a single natural population of D. melanogaster, in which larvae are prone to thermal stress in nature. Hsp70 expression varied more than twofold among lines after induction by exposure to {36?C} for one hour, with an estimated proportion of the variation due to genetic differences of 0.24 {\textpm} 0.08. Thermotolerance with and without a Hsp70-inducing pretreatment, survival at {25?C}, and developmental time also varied significantly. As expected, expression of Hsp70 correlated positively with larval thermotolerance. By contrast, lines in which larval survival was high in the absence of heat stress showed lower than average Hsp70 expression and lower than average inducible thermotolerance. This conditional performance suggests an evolutionary trade-off between thermotolerance and the ability to produce higher concentrations of Hsp70, and survival in a benign environment.},

	abstract = {The principle inducible heat-shock protein of Drosophila melanogaster, Hsp70, contributes to thermotolerance throughout the entire life cycle of the species but may also reduce fitness in some life stages. In principle, selection might maximize the benefits of Hsp70 expression relative to its costs by adjusting the magnitude of Hsp70 expression for each life-cycle stage independently. Therefore we examined whether the magnitude of Hsp70 expression varied during the life cycle and the relationship of this variation to several life-history traits. For 28 isofemale lines derived from a single natural population, estimates of heritable variation in Hsp70 expression ranged between 0.25 and 0.49, and the association among variation in first- and third-instar larvae and in adults correlated highly. Thus, Hsp70 expression is genetically coupled at these developmental stages. A line engineered with extra copies of the hsp70 gene produced more Hsp70 and survived heat shock much better than did a control strain. Among natural lines, Hsp70 expression was only weakly related to tolerance of heat shock and to larva-to-adult survival and developmental time at permissive temperatures. Additionally, lines with high adult survival developed slowly as larvae, which is a possible trade-off. These and other findings suggest that trade-offs may maintain quantitative variation both in heatshock protein expression and in life-history traits that associate with thermotolerance.},

	abstract = {Embryonic development in Drosophila is characterized by an early phase during which a cellular blastoderm is formed and gastrulation takes place, and by a later postgastrulation phase in which key morphogenetic processes such as segmentation and organogenesis occur. We have focused on this later phase in embryogenesis with the goal of obtaining a comprehensive analysis of the zygotic gene expression that occurs during development under normal and altered environmental conditions. For this, a functional genomic approach to embryogenesis has been developed that uses high-density oligonucleotide arrays for large-scale detection and quantification of gene expression. These oligonucleotide arrays were used for quantitative transcript imaging of embryonically expressed genes under standard conditions and in response to heat shock. In embryos raised under standard conditions, transcripts were detected for 37\% of the 1,519 identified genes represented on the arrays, and highly reproducible quantification of gene expression was achieved in all cases. Analysis of differential gene expression after heat shock revealed substantial expression level changes for known heat-shock genes and identified numerous heat shock-inducible genes. These results demonstrate that high-density oligonucleotide arrays are sensitive, efficient, and quantitative instruments for the analysis of large scale gene expression in Drosophila embryos.},

	abstract = {Knockdown resistance to high temperature is an ecologically important trait in small insects. A composite interval mapping was performed on the two major autosomes of Drosophila melanogaster to search for quantitative trait loci {(QTL)} affecting knockdown resistance to high temperature {(KRHT).} Two dramatically divergent lines from geographically different thermal environments were artificially selected on {KRHT.} These lines were crossed to produce two backcross {(BC)} populations. Each {BC} was analysed for 200 males with 18 marker loci on chromosomes 2 and 3. Three X-linked markers were used to test for X-linked {QTL} in an exploratory way. The largest estimate of autosome additive effects was found in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 2, accounting for 19.26\% {(BC} to the low line) and 29.15\% {(BC} to the high line) of the phenotypic variance in {BC} populations, but it could represent multiple closely linked {QTL.} Complete dominance was apparent for three {QTL} on chromosome 3, where heat-shock genes are concentrated. Exploratory analysis of chromosome X indicated a substantial contribution of this chromosome to {KRHT.} The results show that a large-effect {QTL} with dominant gene action maps on the right arm of chromosome 3. Further, the results confirm that {QTL} for heat resistance are not limited to chromosome 3.},
