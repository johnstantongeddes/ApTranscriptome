	abstract = {Motivation: The result of a typical microarray experiment is a long list of genes with corresponding expression measurements. This list is only the starting point for a meaningful biological interpretation. Modern methods identify relevant biological processes or functions from gene expression data by scoring the statistical significance of predefined functional gene groups, e.g. based on Gene Ontology ({GO).} We develop methods that increase the explanatory power of this approach by integrating knowledge about relationships between the {GO} terms into the calculation of the statistical significance.
Results: We present two novel algorithms that improve {GO} group scoring using the underlying {GO} graph topology. The algorithms are evaluated on real and simulated gene expression data. We show that both methods eliminate local dependencies between {GO} terms and point to relevant areas in the {GO} graph that remain undetected with state-of-the-art algorithms for scoring functional terms. A simulation study demonstrates that the new methods exhibit a higher level of detecting relevant biological terms than competing methods.

	abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate ({FWER).} This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the {FWER} when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the {FWER} is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

	abstract = {Theory predicts that geographic variation in traits and genes associated with climatic adaptation may be initially driven by the correlated evolution of thermal preference and thermal sensitivity. This assumes that an organism’s preferred body temperature corresponds with the thermal optimum in which performance is maximized; hence, shifts in thermal preferences affect the subsequent evolution of thermal-related traits. Drosophila subobscura evolved worldwide latitudinal clines in several traits including chromosome inversion frequencies, with some polymorphic inversions being apparently associated with thermal preference and thermal tolerance. Here we show that flies carrying the warm-climate chromosome arrangement O3+4 have higher basal protein levels of Hsp70 than their cold-climate Ost counterparts, but this difference disappears after heat hardening. O3+4 carriers are also more heat tolerant, although it is difficult to conclude from our results that this is causally linked to their higher basal levels of Hsp70. The observed patterns are consistent with the thermal co-adaptation hypothesis and suggest that the interplay between behaviour and physiology underlies latitudinal and seasonal shifts in inversion frequencies.},

Designing experiments with discrete factors is straightforward because {ANOVA} is the only option, but what is the best way to design experiments involving continuous factors? Should ecologists prefer experiments with few treatments and many replicates analyzed with {ANOVA}, or experiments with many treatments and few replicates per treatment analyzed with regression? We recommend that ecologists choose regression, especially replicated regression, over {ANOVA} when dealing with continuous factors for two reasons: (1) regression is generally a more powerful approach than {ANOVA} and (2) regression provides quantitative output that can be incorporated into ecological models more effectively than {ANOVA} output.},

The functional role of these proteins is well known at the cellular level. Today increasing interest has been directed towards the importance of heat-shock proteins for resistance of whole organisms to high-temperature stress and other environmental stressors.2. Here the functional relationship between the heat-shock protein, Hsp70, and thermal resistance in adult Drosophila melanogaster was examined by comparing thermal resistance, i.e. survival at 39 {°C} for 85 min, and levels of Hsp70 at various times elapsed (2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 h) after thermotolerance was induced by short-term acclimation/heat hardening at 37 {°C} for 55 min.3. Levels of Hsp70 in both males and females were highest 2 h after heat hardening and declined with longer times elapsed. The rate of decrease initially was very fast but diminished with increasing time. After 32 h the level of Hsp70 approached the level in flies that were not hardened. Levels of Hsp70 in males exceeded that of females during the entire period.4. Survival of both sexes increased with increasing time after heat hardening and reached an optimum between 8 and 32 h. Thereafter resistance decreased with longer times elapsed. Survival of females generally exceeded that of males except after 16 and 64 h.5. Regression analysis applied to the data on Hsp70 levels revealed that the model describing these data could not explain the data for survival. Also, higher levels of Hsp70 in males compared with females were not associated with greater survival in males. However, statistical analysis on paired measurements of Hsp70 and survival revealed a positive association between Hsp70 level and survival at each time elapsed after induction of thermotolerance.},

	abstract = {The impact of anthropogenic climate change on terrestrial organisms is often predicted to increase with latitude, in parallel with the rate of warming. Yet the biological impact of rising temperatures also depends on the physiological sensitivity of organisms to temperature change. We integrate empirical fitness curves describing the thermal tolerance of terrestrial insects from around the world with the projected geographic distribution of climate change for the next century to estimate the direct impact of warming on insect fitness across latitude. The results show that warming in the tropics, although relatively small in magnitude, is likely to have the most deleterious consequences because tropical insects are relatively sensitive to temperature change and are currently living very close to their optimal temperature. In contrast, species at higher latitudes have broader thermal tolerance and are living in climates that are currently cooler than their physiological optima, so that warming may even enhance their fitness. Available thermal tolerance data for several vertebrate taxa exhibit similar patterns, suggesting that these results are general for terrestrial ectotherms. Our analyses imply that, in the absence of ameliorating factors such as migration and adaptation, the greatest extinction risks from global warming may be in the tropics, where biological diversity is also greatest.},

In this article, we present a prospectus for transferring our basic understanding of evolutionary rescue to wild and other non-laboratory populations. Current experimental and theoretical results emphasize how the interplay between inheritance processes and absolute fitness in changed environments drive population dynamics and determine prospects of extinction. We discuss the challenge of inferring these elements of the evolutionary rescue process in field and natural settings. Addressing this challenge will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of population persistence that combines processes of evolutionary rescue with developmental and ecological mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Collective behaviour, arising from local interactions, allows groups to respond to changing conditions. Long-term studies have shown that the traits of individual mammals and birds are associated with their reproductive success, but little is known about the evolutionary ecology of collective behaviour in natural populations. An ant colony operates without central control, regulating its activity through a network of local interactions. This work shows that variation among harvester ant (Pogonomyrmex barbatus) colonies in collective response to changing conditions is related to variation in colony lifetime reproductive success in the production of offspring colonies. Desiccation costs are high for harvester ants foraging in the desert. More successful colonies tend to forage less when conditions are dry, and show relatively stable foraging activity when conditions are more humid. Restraint from foraging does not compromise a colony/'s long-term survival; colonies that fail to forage at all on many days survive as long, over the colony/'s 20-30-year lifespan, as those that forage more regularly. Sensitivity to conditions in which to reduce foraging activity may be transmissible from parent to offspring colony. These results indicate that natural selection is shaping the collective behaviour that regulates foraging activity, and that the selection pressure, related to climate, may grow stronger if the current drought in their habitat persists.},

By efficiently constructing and analyzing sets of de Bruijn graphs, Trinity fully reconstructs a large fraction of transcripts, including alternatively spliced isoforms and transcripts from recently duplicated genes. Compared with other de novo transcriptome assemblers, Trinity recovers more full-length transcripts across a broad range of expression levels, with a sensitivity similar to methods that rely on genome alignments.

	abstract = {Motivation: High-throughput experiments such as microarray hybridizations often yield long lists of genes found to share a certain characteristic such as differential expression. Exploring Gene Ontology ({GO)} annotations for such lists of genes has become a widespread practice to get first insights into the potential biological meaning of the experiment. The standard statistical approach to measuring overrepresentation of {GO} terms cannot cope with the dependencies resulting from the structure of {GO} because they analyze each term in isolation. Especially the fact that annotations are inherited from more specific descendant terms can result in certain types of false-positive results with potentially misleading biological interpretation, a phenomenon which we term the inheritance problem.
Results: We present here a novel approach to analysis of {GO} term overrepresentation that determines overrepresentation of terms in the context of annotations to the term's parents. This approach reduces the dependencies between the individual term's measurements, and thereby avoids producing false-positive results owing to the inheritance problem. {ROC} analysis using study sets with overrepresented {GO} terms showed a clear advantage for our approach over the standard algorithm with respect to the inheritance problem. Although there can be no gold standard for exploratory methods such as analysis of {GO} term overrepresentation, analysis of biological datasets suggests that our algorithm tends to identify the core {GO} terms that are most characteristic of the dataset being analyzed.

Analyses of the fitness consequences of climate change have generally omitted negative fitness and population declines associated with heat stress. * Here, we examine how seasonal and interannual temperature variability will impact fitness shifts of ectotherms from the past (1961–1990) to future (2071–2100), by modelling thermal performance curves ({TPCs)} for insect species across latitudes. * In temperate regions, climate change increased the length of the growing season (increasing fitness) and increased the frequency of heat stress (decreasing fitness). Consequently, species at mid-latitudes (20–40°) showed pronounced but heterogeneous responses to climate change. Fitness decreases for these species were accompanied by greater interannual variation in fitness. An alternative {TPC} model and a larger data set gave qualitatively similar results. * How close maximum summer temperatures are to the critical thermal maximum of a species – the thermal buffer – is a good predictor of the change in mean fitness expected under climate change. Thermal buffers will decrease to near or below zero by 2100 for many tropical and mid-latitude species. * Our forecasts suggest that mid-latitude species will be particularly susceptible to heat stress associated with climate change due to temperature variation.},

We have characterized variation in first-instar larvae of 20 isofemale lines isolated from a single natural population of D. melanogaster, in which larvae are prone to thermal stress in nature. Hsp70 expression varied more than twofold among lines after induction by exposure to {36⚬C} for one hour, with an estimated proportion of the variation due to genetic differences of 0.24 ± 0.08. Thermotolerance with and without a Hsp70-inducing pretreatment, survival at {25⚬C}, and developmental time also varied significantly. As expected, expression of Hsp70 correlated positively with larval thermotolerance. By contrast, lines in which larval survival was high in the absence of heat stress showed lower than average Hsp70 expression and lower than average inducible thermotolerance. This conditional performance suggests an evolutionary trade-off between thermotolerance and the ability to produce higher concentrations of Hsp70, and survival in a benign environment.},

	abstract = {The principle inducible heat-shock protein of Drosophila melanogaster, Hsp70, contributes to thermotolerance throughout the entire life cycle of the species but may also reduce fitness in some life stages. In principle, selection might maximize the benefits of Hsp70 expression relative to its costs by adjusting the magnitude of Hsp70 expression for each life-cycle stage independently. Therefore we examined whether the magnitude of Hsp70 expression varied during the life cycle and the relationship of this variation to several life-history traits. For 28 isofemale lines derived from a single natural population, estimates of heritable variation in Hsp70 expression ranged between 0.25 and 0.49, and the association among variation in first- and third-instar larvae and in adults correlated highly. Thus, Hsp70 expression is genetically coupled at these developmental stages. A line engineered with extra copies of the hsp70 gene produced more Hsp70 and survived heat shock much better than did a control strain. Among natural lines, Hsp70 expression was only weakly related to tolerance of heat shock and to larva-to-adult survival and developmental time at permissive temperatures. Additionally, lines with high adult survival developed slowly as larvae, which is a possible trade-off. These and other findings suggest that trade-offs may maintain quantitative variation both in heatshock protein expression and in life-history traits that associate with thermotolerance.},

We have focused on this later phase in embryogenesis with the goal of obtaining a comprehensive analysis of the zygotic gene expression that occurs during development under normal and altered environmental conditions. For this, a functional genomic approach to embryogenesis has been developed that uses high-density oligonucleotide arrays for large-scale detection and quantification of gene expression. These oligonucleotide arrays were used for quantitative transcript imaging of embryonically expressed genes under standard conditions and in response to heat shock. In embryos raised under standard conditions, transcripts were detected for 37\% of the 1,519 identified genes represented on the arrays, and highly reproducible quantification of gene expression was achieved in all cases. Analysis of differential gene expression after heat shock revealed substantial expression level changes for known heat-shock genes and identified numerous heat shock-inducible genes. These results demonstrate that high-density oligonucleotide arrays are sensitive, efficient, and quantitative instruments for the analysis of large scale gene expression in Drosophila embryos.},

	abstract = {For insects, temperature is a major environmental variable that can influence an individual's behavioral activities and fitness. Drosophila melanogaster is a cosmopolitan species that has had great success in adapting to and colonizing diverse thermal niches. This adaptation and colonization has resulted in complex patterns of genetic variation in thermotolerance phenotypes in nature. Although extensive work has been conducted documenting patterns of genetic variation, substantially less is known about the genomic regions or genes that underlie this ecologically and evolutionarily important genetic variation. To begin to understand and identify the genes controlling thermotolerance phenotypes, we have used a mapping population of recombinant inbred ({RI)} lines to map quantitative trait loci ({QTL)} that affect variation in both heat- and cold-stress resistance. The mapping population was derived from a cross between two lines of D. melanogaster (Oregon-R and 2b) that were not selected for thermotolerance phenotypes, but exhibit significant genetic divergence for both phenotypes. Using a design in which each {RI} line was backcrossed to both parental lines, we mapped seven {QTL} affecting thermotolerance on the second and third chromosomes. Three of the {QTL} influence cold-stress resistance and four affect heat-stress resistance. Most of the {QTL} were trait or sex specific, suggesting that overlapping but generally unique genetic architectures underlie resistance to low- and high-temperature extremes. Each {QTL} explained between 5 and 14\% of the genetic variance among lines, and degrees of dominance ranged from completely additive to partial dominance. Potential thermotolerance candidate loci contained within our {QTL} regions are identified and discussed.},

A composite interval mapping was performed on the two major autosomes of Drosophila melanogaster to search for quantitative trait loci ({QTL)} affecting knockdown resistance to high temperature ({KRHT).} Two dramatically divergent lines from geographically different thermal environments were artificially selected on {KRHT.} These lines were crossed to produce two backcross ({BC)} populations. Each {BC} was analysed for 200 males with 18 marker loci on chromosomes 2 and 3. Three X-linked markers were used to test for X-linked {QTL} in an exploratory way. The largest estimate of autosome additive effects was found in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 2, accounting for 19.26\% ({BC} to the low line) and 29.15\% ({BC} to the high line) of the phenotypic variance in {BC} populations, but it could represent multiple closely linked {QTL.} Complete dominance was apparent for three {QTL} on chromosome 3, where heat-shock genes are concentrated. Exploratory analysis of chromosome X indicated a substantial contribution of this chromosome to {KRHT.} The results show that a large-effect {QTL} with dominant gene action maps on the right arm of chromosome 3. Further, the results confirm that {QTL} for heat resistance are not limited to chromosome 3.},

Requirements of large offspring numbers coupled with fitness variation in the surviving cohort limit the use of some standard genetic analyses for estimating heritability. Therefore, we present an isofemale line analysis, which is a modified full-sib design, to estimate heritability of tolerance to heat shock in pretreated Drosophila buzzatii adults. Highly significant levels of genetic variation were found in males and females at the third generation of laboratory rearing, and the intraclass correlations were estimated to be about 0.2 for four independent sets of 25 isofemale lines. The proportion of the variance explained within lines among same-sex replicates, however, was larger than that between replicates of males and females. Because genetic variation was estimated from groups, the error variation required factoring by the group size to estimate heritability, which averaged 0.03. The four most tolerant, four least tolerant and four lines of average tolerance to heat stress in each set were reanalysed after 10–11 generations of rearing at {25°C.} Survival in the 13th–14th generations was positively and significantly associated with survival at generation 3. These comparisons indicate the high repeatability of measurements of heat-shock tolerance.},

We used a paternal half-sibling breeding design to examine whether sex-specific genetic architectures and genetic covariances between traits might constrain evolutionary responses to warming climates in a population of Drosophila melanogaster. Our results suggest that the sexes share a common genetic underpinning for heat tolerance as indicated by a strong positive inter-sexual genetic correlation. Further, we found no evidence in either of the sexes that genetic trade-offs between heat tolerance and fitness will constrain responses to thermal selection.

	abstract = {Background
{RNA-seq} has shown huge potential for phylogenomic inferences in non-model organisms. However, error, incompleteness, and redundant assembled transcripts for each gene in de novo assembly of short reads cause noise in analyses and a large amount of missing data in the aligned matrix. To address these problems, we compare de novo assemblies of paired end 90 bp {RNA-seq} reads using Oases, Trinity, Trans-{ABySS} and {SOAPdenovo-Trans} to transcripts from genome annotation of the model plant Ricinus communis. By doing so we evaluate strategies for optimizing total gene coverage and minimizing assembly chimeras and redundancy.

Results
We found that the frequency and structure of chimeras vary dramatically among different software packages. The differences were largely due to the number of trans-self chimeras that contain repeats in the opposite direction. More than half of the total chimeras in Oases and Trinity were trans-self chimeras. Within each package, we found a trade-off between maximizing reference coverage and minimizing redundancy and chimera rate. In order to reduce redundancy, we investigated three methods: 1) using cap3 and {CD-HIT-EST} to combine highly similar transcripts, 2) only retaining the transcript with the highest read coverage, or removing the transcript with the lowest read coverage for each subcomponent in Trinity, and 3) filtering Oases single k-mer assemblies by number of transcripts per locus and relative transcript length, and then finding the transcript with the highest read coverage. We then utilized results from blastx against model protein sequences to effectively remove trans chimeras. After optimization, seven assembly strategies among all four packages successfully assembled 42.9–47.1\% of reference genes to more than 200 bp, with a chimera rate of 0.92–2.21\%, and on average 1.8–3.1 transcripts per reference gene assembled.

Conclusions
With rapidly improving sequencing and assembly tools, our study provides a framework to benchmark and optimize performance before choosing tools or parameter combinations for analyzing short-read {RNA-seq} data. Our study demonstrates that choice of assembly package, k-mer sizes, post-assembly redundancy-reduction and chimera cleanup, and strand-specific {RNA-seq} library preparation and assembly dramatically improves gene coverage by non-redundant and non-chimeric transcripts that are optimized for downstream phylogenomic analyses.},
