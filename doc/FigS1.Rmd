Figure S1. Deviations from expected numbers of transcripts in matched observations of transcript expression type between species (*A. carolinensis* on rows, *A. picea* on columns). The color of each cell represents the deviation of the observed from the expected number of transcripts based on hypothetical equivalence of the marginal frequencies (blue = excess, red = deficit). The expression types are **Low** transcripts that had greatest expression temperatures < 10°C, **Intermediate** transcripts with greatest expression between 10 and 30°C, **High** transcripts that had greatest expression at temperatures > 31°, **Bimodal** transcripts with increased expression at both high and low temperatures, and **Not Responsive** transcripts that were not thermally responsive in that species.
